# The multiobjective optimization routines here can use any crossover
# and mutation pipeline you like, but the literature tends to stick with
# SBX for crossover and Polynomial Mutation.  And with good reason: our
# tests indicate that Polynomial Mutation is much better than Gaussian of
# any setting for these problems.  And for SPEA2 at least, SBX seems to
# outperform most other crossover operators.  Note that we're using the
# "bounded" Polynomial Mutation variant, which seems to do a bit better.
