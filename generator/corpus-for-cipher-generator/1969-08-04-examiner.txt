This is the Zodiac speaking.
In answer to your asking for more details about the good times I have had in 
Vallejo, I shall be very happy to supply even more material. By the way, are 
the police having a good time with the code? If not, tell them to cheer up; 
when they do crack it, they will have me.
On the 4th of July I did not open the car door. The window was rolled down all 
ready. The boy was origionaly sitting in the front seat when I began fireing. 
When I fired the first shot at his head, he leaped backwards at the same time, 
thus spoiling my aim. He ended up on the back seat then the floor in back 
thashing out very violently with his legs; that's how I shot him in the knee. I 
did not leave the cene of the killing with squealing tires + raceing engine as 
described in the Vallejo paper. I drove away quite slowly so as not to draw 
attention to my car. The man who told police that my car was brown was a negro 
about 40-45 rather shabbly dressed. I was in this phone booth having some fun 
with the Vallejo cop when he was walking by. When I hung the phone up the damn 
thing began to ring & that drew his attention to me + my car.
Last Christmass In that epasode the police were wondering how I could shoot + 
hit my victims in the dark. They did not openly state this, but implied this by 
saying it was a well lit night + I could see silowets on the horizon. Bullshit 
that area is srounded by high hills + trees. What I did was tape a small pencel 
flash light to the barrel of my gun. If you notice, in the center of the beam 
of light if you aim it at a wall or ceiling you will see a black or darck spot 
in the center of the circle of light about 3 to 6 inches across. When taped to 
a gun barrel, the bullet will strike in the center of the black dot in the 
light. All I had to do was spray them as if it was a water hose; there was no 
need to use the gun sights. I was not happy to see that I did not get front 
page coverage.
