This is the Zodiac speaking
Like I have allways said, I am crack proof. If the Blue Meannies are evere 
going to catch me, they had best get off their fat asses + do something. 
Because the longer they fiddle + fart around, the more slaves I will collect 
for my after life. I do have to give them credit for stumbling across my 
riverside activity, but they are only finding the easy ones, there are a hell 
of a lot more down there. The reason I'm writing to the Times is this, They 
don't bury me on the back pages like some of the others.
