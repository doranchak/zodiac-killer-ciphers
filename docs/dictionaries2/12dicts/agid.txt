Automatically Generated Inflection Database (AGID)

August 19, 2000
Revision 2

Copyright 2000 by Kevin Atkinson <kevina@users.sourceforge.net>

The file "infl.txt" is an automatically created database of the
inflected forms of words from an insanely large word list.

The latest version can be found at http://aspell.sourceforge.net/wl/.

Entries are in the following form.

<word> <pos>: <inflected forms>

Where <pos> is V for verb, N for noun, or A or adjective or adverb.
If <pos> is followed by a ? that means that the part-of-speech was not
in the part-of-speech database however the inflected forms of the word
where found in the word list.

The inflected forms are in the following order for verbs (except for
the verb "be"):
  <past tense>  [<past participle>]  <-ing form>  <plural form>
and for adjective or adverbs:
  <-er form>  <-est form>
There are two spaces between each form.

A word in parentheses mean that it is considered a less preferred form
of the previous inflection.  Two parentheses means that the word is
even less preferred, etc.  A / between two words means that the two
words are considered almost equal variants or that is is difficult to
tell which one is the primary form.  They are ordered by preference
however sometime this distinction is so slight it is meaningless.  A
"|" between words means that both inflections are used depending on
the meaning of the word.  If the distinction between the two forms can
be described in a word than that word is found after the word in
braces, for example:

  hang V: hung {suspend} | hanged {execute}  hanging  hangs

Notice how there is two spaces between the past tense, -ing form and
plural form but not between the alternate forms of the past tense.  In
general, if the "|" symbol would be needed more than once the words
the entry is split up into multiple lines like so:

  <word> [{explanation}] <POS>: <inflected forms>

However, the past particle as past tense form are considered a single
form. Thus, a "|" may appear more than once when the word contains
both a past participial and past tense form.

A /? between words means that both inflections were found in the word
list but the script was not sure which one to use.  A ~ after a word
means that there is a slight chance that it is the plural of a word.
A ! after a word indicates that the word is likely an inflections of a
similar word (generally one ending in e) and not the current word.  A
? after a word means that the word was not in the word list but if it
was it would be considered an inflected form of the base word.

Fell free to send me corrections to correct any of these questionable
words.  I am mostly interested in the preferred form of the word in
the case of /? or words marked with a ~ that are actually valid.

Words are in mixed case but all accents have been scripted thus words
like café are instead cafe.

The file "variant" contains a list of alternate inflections.

The file "irregular" contains extra information where a noun or verb
has irregular inflected forms.

The file "dontuse" contains a list of words not to consider an
inflected form of a word if more than one inflected form of a word is
found.

The files "prefixes" and "suffixes" contains a list of common prefixes
and suffixes respectfully.  These files are used by the script to
produce inflected forms for words that end in a word in the
"irregular" file. If the beginning appears in the word list or the
prefixes file and the ending appears in the irregular file I also
consider <prefix>+<irregular inflections>.  If the prefix is 3 letters
or more OR appears in the prefixes file and the suffix is 4 letters or
more OR appears in the suffixes file I consider it the most likely
choice, otherwise I consider it as a possible candidate but not the
most likely choice.

The file "make-infl" is the actual Perl script used to create the
data base.

CHANGES:

From Revision 1 to 2 (August 18, 2000)

  Classified variants as either almost equal, also used, or
  secondary.

  The / is now used to indicate equal variants.  "/?" is now used to
  mean what "/" used to be.

  Lots of additional rules added which greatly improved the results.

     list is our gift to the Scrabble community, as an alternate to
     "official" word lists. Game designers may feel free to
     incorporate the WORD.LST into their games. Please mention the
     source and credit us as originators of the list. Note that if
     you, as a game designer, use the WORD.LST in your product, you
