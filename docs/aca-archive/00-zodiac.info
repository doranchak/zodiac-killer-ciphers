Subject: ZODIAC's Cipher Note

Krewe,

I've been watching an old (vintage 1970's) British crime documentary that is
being rerun on the History channel each week. Normally, it is about famous
British crimes but occasionally they feature US crimes. I guess they run out
of material.

In any case, last week it was about US serial killers and it detailed three
that were never captured which were all named ZODIAC. One was active in the
San Francisco area from December 1968 for about a year. In his letters to
local newspapers he claimed about seven victims.

The first letter was sent to three different SF papers and included with it
was an enciphered note. One page of these cipher symbols, a third of the
note, was sent to each paper with a demand that they be printed on the front
page. Each paper did that.

The authorities were unable to decipher the note, but a San Francisco school
teacher finally cracked it. It was not a simple task and it revealed no clues
that could aid the investigation.

I have a copy of the note. I taped the show and was able to freeze the images
of the pages and copy them down. Unfortunately, also included was a brief
description of how it was cracked and a partial showing of the plaintext.
There was enough that completing the 'solve' was no longer a challenge,
except for the mistakes in the text, that at first were quite confusing and
probably would make the 'solve' much more difficult.

If this is not news to everyone and if this has already been a topic of
review by members of the Krewe or the subject of a book, then this post has
been a waste of your time. So, in the words of Emily Latilla - "Never mind."

If however, there is a crew member who is not familiar with this ciphertext
and would like to 'give it a go' then I will break out my scanner and
'convert' the three part text into .jpg images (it is in letters and symbols
not all of which are found on the keyboard) and send them as a Zip file to
anyone who asks.

Regards,

FOX

The solver of the Zodiac's first cryptogram was a Salinas high
school teacher (math I think) and his wife. Interestingly,
it did not reveal who the killer was.

The second cryptogram remains unsolved although several
authors claim to have solved it. It is available on the net
but I seem to have lost the URL.

Then there were a number of postcards the Zodiac sent to
the SF Police homicide detective, Inspector Toschi, taunting
him. Some were encrypted.

The Zodiac claimed that his victims would become his slaves
in the hereafter.

One time he particularly terrified the Bay Area. He threatened
to "pick off the kiddies as they come bounding off the school
bus."

I've saved the 2nd cryptogram for years promising myself that
someday in my retirement I would work on it. (I copied it
character by character from the SF Chronicle.) I haven't
gotten around to it yet.

Hi

I remember the ZODIAC scare well.  Everybody was concerned.

If I recall, the 8 November 1969 second letter was solved by Robert
Graysmith back in August 1979. He wrote an interesting account called
ZODIAC , published by Berkley Books, 1976, [ISBN0-425-09808-7]

He actually sent his solution to the Kent State Conference to Greg Mellon
and Eugene Waltz.

The cipher is a substitution -transposition with 65-different symbols in the
cipher with 43 occurring 5 times or less. It is essentially a Homophonic
with variations as WFF used to write. Only two the + and the B occurred more
than 10x. It was not the same type of cipher as solved by the Hardens. The E
had 10 different equivalents, S had 9 and A had 7. The backwards C and
multiple L's  were nulls. The key word was the name of the reporter at SF
Chronicle. The ciphertext is full of proper names. Two clues ( I can supply
more for those interested) are: the first 8 symbols are key and POSHT/ is an
anagram for the Detective on the case TOSHI

Best to all

LANAKI

KREWE:

Zodiac has been featured in The Cryptogram in at least four issues, see your
index for details.

An excellent book on the subject was writtne by a newspaperman who also
solved one of the messages. The book is ZODIAC by Robert Graysmith, NY: St.
Martin's/Marek, 1986, 337 pp. He also describes ACA assistance. Includes all
ciphers.
