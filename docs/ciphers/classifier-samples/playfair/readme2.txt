With permission from Willian Mason (BION) I've enciphered his 10,000 
plaintexts in Playfair, using the left keysquare from his four-square 
and two-square encipherments. 

The file is just a text file, with 10,000 lines of ciphertext, 
one construction per line. 

It is available, uncompressed, at:

If you would like to use the original two-square and four-square 
examples but you are having trouble unzipping it this file is 
compressed with different parameters than William Mason's original:
