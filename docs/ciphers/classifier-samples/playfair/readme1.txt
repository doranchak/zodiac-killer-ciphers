Collection of two-square and four-square ciphers.

I've been trying to find some kind of test that can distinguish between a four-square cipher and a two-square cipher. So far nothing has turned up that's better than the reverse log digraph test. But in the process I've randomly generated 10,000 four-square ciphers and 10,000 two-square ciphers. If anybody wants to use the ciphers for their own experiments you can find them in zipped form at the links below.

Each line of the (unzipped) file contains 8 fields separated by commas:
(0) The plaintext (200 letters)
(1) left key
(2) left route number
(3) right key
(4) right route number
(5) four-square cipher
(6) some frequency data for the four-square
(7) two-square cipher
(8) some frequency data for the two-square
