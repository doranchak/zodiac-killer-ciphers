10,000 Gromark and Progressive key ciphers.

One of the problems that my cipher ID tests have encountered is telling the difference between Gromark ciphers and Progressive key ciphers. In order to work on this problem I generated 10,000 Gromark and 10,000 (Vigenere) Progressive key ciphers. If anybody wants to try their hand at figuring out which is which, the ciphers are stored in zipped form at the links below.

Each line of the unzipped file has 6 fields separated by commas: (1) plaintext, (2) key, (3) Gromark primer, (4) Gromark cipher with given key and primer, (5) progression index, (6) Progressive key cipher -- with given progression index and key same as Gromark key
