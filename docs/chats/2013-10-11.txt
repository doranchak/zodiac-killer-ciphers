Carol says to  (19:34:22):
I remember when he was in the 8th grade, he went treat and treating.  Costume.....old chirt, really baggy pants and a big rain boot on his head.  I never laughed so hard in my life.  Paul had ewonderful true friends throughout high scvhool!

Carol says to  (19:36:12):
While working for Turlock Journal, did an article about one of the vcoaches in June 1957 (right before graduation).  It was picked up by UPI.  For some reason or another, the coach didn't think it was funny.  Had something to do with torn pants

SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:35:47):
hahahahaha
Chiefron says to  (22:36:59):
My son was doing security at the 49r Packers game this year when that guy fell off the elevated walk way and died, he said the guy was really drunk and had punched a woman in the face. I misssed it all. I was sitting too close to the field =P
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:37:52):
jeezuz well in a way i guess its karma
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:37:57):
for punchin a chick like that
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:38:02):
lol
Chiefron says to  (22:39:51):
Ya, he said he chased the guy (even though he wasn't supposed to) untilt he guy ran into some SFPD. The SFPD refused to arrest the guy. Would have been better if they had. One thing I noticed at that game is that 49er fans are not happy drunks or gracious winners lol
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:41:12):
lol
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:41:16):

tracers says to  (03:17:33):
Tom being on a show to discuss zodiac does not mean tom believes in ghosts or that Gaik's ghost is at the Gazette

Tahoe27 says to  (05:53:28):
Carol...do you know if Paul would EVER work/drive without his glasses?  They didn't appear to be recovered in the cab.
Paradice says to  (05:53:29):
because they would have to adjust the mirror is my thinking
Carol says to  (05:53:35):
They did find a finger print did you guys know?  Not in the system

A few more notes from our conversation:

My Sept. 12, 2007 story was confirmed; at the time of his murder, Paul had been hired as a reporter by the San Francisco Chronicle and was officially an employee there, and was quitting his Yellow cab job. It makes me wonder if the Chronicle kept it a secret for obvious reasons.
Carol says to  (06:05:11):
I know he had the offer from Joe told me but there no changes in Paul's trip to BC from what he told me
Shawn says to  (06:05:45):
Carol confirmed that she had been contacted by Blaine back in the 1980s. She also confirmed that Blaine showed her a picture of a man, and that she recognized him as being at Paul's funeral. That photo Blaine showed Carol was of Richard Gaikowski.
Carol says to  (06:05:49):
The paper even said this in the newspaper if you guys c heck
*** (06:06:11):miss quit the room
Daisymay says to  (06:06:15):

Didn't Paul Avery report this as well.  Blaine T Blaine also confirmed it as well
Paradice says to  (06:09:19):
I hope so, or I am wasting my time
SerialProfilingFan says to  (06:09:22):
lol
tracers says to  (06:09:26):
Carol, the papers at the time said Paul had been hired or offered a job at the chronicle?
Carol says to  (06:09:55):
Yes he had been offerred a job at the Chronicle
Angie says to  (06:10:03):
lol TY Para :)
Carol says to  (06:10:23):
Never ask Claudia.  She really wasn't talking to the family!
Shawn says to  (06:10:23):
<--- Confused
judith says to  (06:10:37):
"offerred" a job
Angie says to  (06:10:37):
Why, Shawn?
tracers says to  (06:10:40):
and joe told you that too, butPaul told you he wanted to go to grad school in BC?
Jeffery Dumber says to  (06:10:53):
omg, you said it was a rumor earilier Carol?
Carol says to  (06:10:59):
They said he was suppose to start working at the Chronicle as I was told
Jeffery Dumber says to  (06:11:14):
earlier
Carol says to  (06:11:14):
That also was in the hpaper
Shawn says to  (06:11:14):
I thought carol said if Paul was offered a job at the chronicle he would jump at it....but didn't know of an offer...earlier in the chat
Morf says to  (06:11:25):
that doesnt make sense
Jeffery Dumber says to  (06:11:28):
this is different from what you have been saying
Carol says to  (06:11:41):
Paul loved newspaper writing
nancydrew says to  (06:12:07):
ease up on carol guys
nancydrew says to  (06:12:23):
too many questions let her tell her story
Carol says to  (06:12:25):
I just thought it was strange to me that none of the family members knew ahead of time.  Then again with Paul, he was busy with school SF State, various jobs
Carol says to  (06:13:32):
I had just moved toi San Francisco in my apartment on Offarrel in Sept
Tahoe27 says to  (06:13:32):
Sorry Carol!  We are all just trying to clarify.  It's pretty darn interesting if he was going to be working at the Chronicle...just sounds like there is no way to confirm.  ??
andrew39 says to  (06:13:32):
She said it was mentioned in the paper.
Tahoe27 says to  (06:14:21):
So you were in SF when Paul was killed? I thought no family lived there...
Carol says to  (06:14:47):
Yesit was and also Blaine t Blaine found about it.  I was just surprised that my brother Joe didn't know about it.  He and Paul talked regularly.  Joe had visited Paul at the place on Fell
Morf says to  (06:15:08):
Tom wrote this: "story was confirmed; at the time of his murder, Paul had been hired as a reporter by the San Francisco Chronicle and was officially an employee there, and was quitting his Yellow cab job. It makes me wonder if the Chronicle kept it a secret for obvious reasons." seems to be opposite of what Carol was saying. Not to be critical but something doesn't add up
Jeffery Dumber says to  (06:15:08):
disagree nancy, it was pretty much a straight forward question,  earlier she said it was rumor, now she says he was going to start?  Why would we not question this?
Carol says to  (06:15:26):
I had just moved out from Chicago with my company insurance adjusting.  I lived in Cupertino with an aunt until I found a plsacer in SF
snooter says to  (06:16:02):

Carol says to  (06:18:55):
originally a rumor I thought until Blaine T Blaine.  The paper said he was also.  I just figure Paul would have had the good blimp letting all of know!  He would have loved this!
colette says to  (06:18:59):
well he is hearing it 2nd hand morf

Carol, I have an odd question for you. I come from the background of victims advocate, and hate that the victims aren't often remembered as people. What is your happiest memory of Paul?
Daisymay says to  (06:19:39):
BUT THE  DESCRIPTION FITS HIM...
Morf says to  (06:19:39):
$2500 seems steep

Twinkie says to  (07:41:37):
ohhhhhh does he work with any juveniles col?
colette says to  (07:41:43):

colette says to  (07:41:48):

davidmm4299 says to  (07:41:48):

we have a lot of juveniles go up there lol  i bet we've had some of the same kids
judith says to  (07:42:14):
for some reason dmm I kind of doubt it
colette says to  (07:42:19):
i bet
Rehab says to  (07:42:20):
Carol isn't an expert on Gaikowski, so she might not have even put it together until recently
colette says to  (07:42:56):
it was hard to tell what carol was answering because a lot of questions were asked at once
judith says to  (07:42:59):
that is my thought as well Tom
SerialProfilingFan says to  (07:43:00):
she was getting hammered by questions so I am assuming it was getting confusing
Daisymay says to  (07:43:26):
yes kibnda hard to follow
Daisymay says to  (07:43:34):
*kinda
judith says to  (07:43:40):
colette, drew Trace & I had her confirm it at least 3 times I think... we were so stunned wanted to make certain we were understanding her correctly
colette says to  (07:43:40):
true then there was a conflict about whether the job offer was real or not
Daisymay says to  (07:43:59):
right
colette says to  (07:44:16):
i know but then she changed things abit on the newspaper job offer
colette says to  (07:44:46):
so it made me wonder about all
colette says to  (07:45:35):
is there a way to scroll back to reread?
judith says to  (07:45:43):
not for me
judith says to  (07:45:55):
and yes, she was being hammered with questions
colette says to  (07:45:55):
we used to be able to on old chats
colette says to  (07:46:15):
maybe tom can read back later
Daisymay says to  (07:46:15):
 i think she did finally confirm it though didnt she?
colette says to  (07:46:48):
yes it seemed like she did
Daisymay says to  (07:46:48):
not for sure on that
*** (07:46:49):mjer quit the room
judith says to  (07:48:11):
yes she did confirm it several times
Daisymay says to  (07:48:36):
ok at first she said if he had of gotten an offer, he would have jumped on it
judith says to  (07:48:36):
walking distance she said
Rehab says to  (07:48:40):
prety exciting, I know Carol recently went through some of her ister Geneva's materials about Paul
judith says to  (07:48:46):
oh you mean the Chronicle thing, idk
Daisymay says to  (07:48:53):
yes
colette says to  (07:49:04):
oh she said she had something to send you tom
SerialProfilingFan says to  (07:49:13):
she mentioned some interesting thing that happend to her near gustine
SerialProfilingFan says to  (07:49:27):
some guy was trying to get her to pull over
judith says to  (07:49:32):
John's date
colette says to  (07:49:44):
tom is there a way you can scroll back to read?
judith says to  (07:49:44):

woodenigloo says to  (07:55:46):
Lookie, a movie star is in the room!  Eric Idle
SerialProfilingFan says to  (07:55:48):

Rehab says to  (07:55:52):
lolol
judith says to  (07:56:44):
there was such an echo for me I could barely understand the callers
Rehab says to  (07:56:45):
it was a fun show
SerialProfilingFan says to  (07:56:55):
clyde is a cool kat man
Rehab says to  (07:57:00):
they were mostly kooks with a few nuts mixed in
SerialProfilingFan says to  (07:57:23):
MK ULTRA Z
Rehab says to  (07:57:24):
spf are you in Cali?
judith says to  (07:57:24):
do you think the gal that claimed to know Richard was for real?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (07:57:34):
no im in Wisconsin
SerialProfilingFan says to  (07:57:51):
it would be kool to go ghost hunt at the gazette!!!
Rehab says to  (07:58:06):
that's what I meant!
SerialProfilingFan says to  (07:58:09):
she sounded legit
Rehab says to  (07:58:28):
I think so
judith says to  (07:58:45):
thing was she talked about Richard wanting to leave SD and go to CA ... hippies etc
judith says to  (07:59:06):
hippies were not a nationally known thing til about '65
judith says to  (07:59:17):
so I don't know how that fits in with her story
SerialProfilingFan says to  (07:59:42):
I wonder if she would lump that in with like Beats know what im sayin
Rehab says to  (07:59:46):
did anyone listen to the last hour when I broke out the ziplock bag of Uncle Joe's DNA?
judith says to  (07:59:48):
yeah
SerialProfilingFan says to  (07:59:50):
yeah hahaahh
SerialProfilingFan says to  (07:59:56):
stinkypoo biznezz
judith says to  (08:00:03):
and yess spf, possible
Daisymay says to  (08:00:03):
yesssssss
Rehab says to  (08:00:39):
lolol
Daisymay says to  (08:00:45):
didnt sound good
Daisymay says to  (08:00:47):
lol
judith says to  (08:01:11):
I'm wondering too if perhaps Carol and Paul didn't just volunteer at the Switchboard on Fell St... Carol said that is where they met... working for the newspaper
Rehab says to  (08:01:28):
lots of volunteers there
judith says to  (08:01:35):
and that Paul lived @ Fell St first before Claudia moved in
judith says to  (08:01:50):
I meant Claudia re Switchboard
Rehab says to  (08:02:07):
gotta get that dmv letter
SerialProfilingFan says to  (08:02:20):
werd!
judith says to  (08:02:22):
and she didn't give an address for it, just that it was walking distance
davidmm4299 says to  (08:02:42):
yes! got to get that DMV letter!!!
Rehab says to  (08:03:43):
did anyone from other z sites join chat?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (08:04:13):
yup
judith says to  (08:04:13):
Morf was here
davidmm4299 says to  (08:04:13):
I think it must have content that led them to pick out the Count Marco letter. Out of the thousands of crackpot letters, there was some reason that caught their eye. I think it must have some simularity to the mystical DMV letter
Rehab says to  (08:04:55):
did everyone get long?
judith says to  (08:05:20):
we tried to keep the room as open as possible for Carol when she was in
judith says to  (08:05:29):
encouraged other chat to pm's
Rehab says to  (08:05:36):
good!
SerialProfilingFan says to  (08:05:49):
at one point I kinda wanted to mute ppl so carol could speak
judith says to  (08:05:55):
she got hammered with questions though
judith says to  (08:06:05):
she was a good sport
SerialProfilingFan says to  (08:06:05):
yeah she did great
davidmm4299 says to  (08:06:05):
excellengt
Rehab says to  (08:06:06):
Carol is awesome
judith says to  (08:06:15):
yeah spf, it boarded on rude at points
judith says to  (08:06:15):
imo
Rehab says to  (08:06:35):
how did she come off?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (08:06:53):
yeah i hit the sound bites in response to a caller  i regreted it she felt bad about it i appologized
judith says to  (08:07:15):
SPF scared Carol
Rehab says to  (08:07:22):
hahahaha
judith says to  (08:07:25):
she didn't know what the sound bites were about
SerialProfilingFan says to  (08:07:31):
she was a trooper !
SerialProfilingFan says to  (08:07:35):
hope she comes back .
Rehab says to  (08:07:37):
SINCE I KILLED A KID !!!
judith says to  (08:07:39):
yess she was
judith says to  (08:07:46):
yep that's the one
SerialProfilingFan says to  (08:07:53):
yeah the one person was mentioning sam
Rehab says to  (08:08:00):
Good thing there was no "I buried Paul" Beatles sound file
Rehab says to  (08:08:25):
too soon?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (08:08:47):
yeah really i keep forgetting my dark humor is not so good at times .
Rehab says to  (08:09:03):
Carol is pretty salty
judith says to  (08:09:30):
couple of times she gave out a "hey guys...."
judith says to  (08:09:45):
she knows how to stand her ground

Daisymay says to  (08:19:27):
yuck
Rehab says to  (08:19:32):
glad Carol was able to shine tonight
judith says to  (08:20:01):
she held her own but it was a lot to ask
judith says to  (08:20:14):
she had trouble keeping up with the questions
Daisymay says to  (08:20:18):
yes really bombarded
Rehab says to  (08:21:46):
it let her know how much people still care, trust me
judith says to  (08:22:06):
I'm sure there was a lot of good info there
Daisymay says to  (08:22:27):
i hope you can go back thru it and find something tom
judith says to  (08:22:37):
I do too
judith says to  (08:23:06):
she did say "I can't imagine Paul not being involved in any newsaper.  Especially where he lived."
SerialProfilingFan says to  (08:23:06):
indeedy
tracers says to  (08:23:30):
yes
judith says to  (08:24:09):
there was some confusion re The Chronicle job "offerred" though
Daisymay says to  (08:24:09):
its possible too that she didnt know yet about the chronicle?
judith says to  (08:24:19):
idk
Daisymay says to  (08:24:42):
if he just got the offer, he may have not told her about it yet
tracers says to  (08:24:48):
she also said the obit that said jwas from vallejo must have mistyped valleo?
Rehab says to  (08:24:55):
remember, at least one staffer at the Good Times (not Blaine) thought the Zodiac was a contributor
Daisymay says to  (08:25:18):
meaning?
tracers says to  (08:25:30):
i don't uecall that  but i am very tired  i believe you
tracers says to  (08:25:51):
why did they think that?
Rehab says to  (08:26:13):
well, it came up at an editorial meeting, Blaine showed me his notes from 1969 and I photographed thm. One of the staffers said he/she thought the Zodiac killer was affiliated with the Good Times.
judith says to  (08:26:21):
I believe Blaine even said it had been mentioned at a staff meeting?
judith says to  (08:26:24):
jinx
Rehab says to  (08:26:29):
yess
Daisymay says to  (08:26:36):
oic
tracers says to  (08:26:37):
ahhh
tracers says to  (08:26:45):
did the person say why?
Rehab says to  (08:27:04):
I don't believe the person elaborated, as I would guess nobody thought there was any merit
Daisymay says to  (08:27:04):
affiliated how?
Rehab says to  (08:27:33):
it was only one line in Blaine's journal/diary of that day in late 1969
Rehab says to  (08:27:52):
I believe I started a thread about it
Rehab says to  (08:27:56):
with a pic
judith says to  (08:28:03):
I've an old friend who was in the Limelighters and they certainly felt Zodiac was a cast or audience member too though
judith says to  (08:28:15):
everyone suspected everyone in the day
Rehab says to  (08:28:22):
yess
judith says to  (08:28:25):
suspicion was rampant
Rehab says to  (08:28:26):
Uncle Joe syndrome
Daisymay says to  (08:28:43):
im sure
judith says to  (08:28:45):
a little more than that Tom, people were still being murdered
judith says to  (08:28:56):
genuine fear
judith says to  (08:29:12):
but I see what you mean
Rehab says to  (08:29:20):
yess, even the Grateful dead and Jim Morrison were scared
Daisymay says to  (08:29:24):

Rehab says to  (08:29:49):
"Riders On The Storm" was based in part by the Zodiac
Daisymay says to  (08:29:58):

Daisymay says to  (08:33:43):
i had, dont know where they are now. the crime and punishment books
tracers says to  (08:33:46):
judith is that thread tom mentioned he posted pix and then wrote  "Here's a close-up of an entry from early January 1970. It reads:

"A curious note on NAME REDACTED; it was mentioned that people in the GOOD TIMES thought him the ZODIAC."

The man in question was described as being Gyke's lackey, who would drive Gyke around the Bay Area every Thursday to deliver new issues of the Good Times. The man lived in the commune but didn't fit in, as he was more of a blue collar type and not a writer or
tracers says to  (08:34:07):
activist"
Rehab says to  (08:34:19):
Ed Skully, I bet
Rehab says to  (08:34:30):
he comes to chat occasionally
tracers says to  (08:34:46):
what about ed skully?
judith says to  (08:34:47):
ty Trace
judith says to  (08:35:23):
Nancy was a Z victim as well
judith says to  (08:35:31):
took a toll on her
tracers says to  (08:35:53):
yesssss
tracers says to  (08:36:05):
imagine having your name and addy in the paper
tracers says to  (08:36:09):

Daisymay says to  (08:36:14):

Daisymay says to  (08:36:25):

judith says to  (08:37:00):
and she was alone with small children to raise
tracers says to  (08:37:06):
when you know something is for sure very wrong
Rehab says to  (08:37:34):
I don't know for sure if he was the
individual from Blaine's notes, but Ed Skully was
Gyke's lackey
Daisymay says to  (08:37:49):
oh thats what i thot you meant
judith says to  (08:37:56):

tracers says to  (08:38:02):

Daisymay says to  (08:38:36):

Rehab says to  (08:39:11):

Rehab says to  (08:39:28):
I posted what I saw, it's been a while
Daisymay says to  (08:39:36):
thats possible too
judith says to  (08:39:47):
I can't imagine Blaine was well liked
Rehab says to  (08:39:50):
Blaine was never a member of the Good Times commune
Rehab says to  (08:40:06):
he contributed to the paper with Cop Watch, that's it
Rehab says to  (08:40:12):
IIRC
judith says to  (08:40:23):

609 says to  (17:19:13):
im new here, what do u usualy talk about?
woodenigloo says to  (17:19:25):
the zodiac killer
609 says to  (17:19:36):
aaa :)
609 says to  (17:19:52):
i have my own theory
woodenigloo says to  (17:20:03):
what's that?
609 says to  (17:20:33):
its so dumb i wont say it :)
woodenigloo says to  (17:20:45):
no, go ahead and say it
609 says to  (17:21:19):
maby some other time
609 says to  (17:21:54):
what do u think, how many he killed
609 says to  (17:22:13):
i think not 37
woodenigloo says to  (17:22:13):
5
609 says to  (17:22:28):
thats more like it
woodenigloo says to  (17:22:43):
as the zodiac killer
woodenigloo says to  (17:23:17):
he could have killed bates and domingez and edwards
609 says to  (17:23:29):
u mean he maby killed others but not tell
woodenigloo says to  (17:24:26):
zodiac wrote:  me - 37  sfpd - 0
woodenigloo says to  (17:24:44):
my suspect was 37 years old when he wrote that
woodenigloo says to  (17:24:56):
richard gaiikowski
609 says to  (17:25:59):
i have looked now like a week all the codes and they dont make any sense
woodenigloo says to  (17:26:23):
the 408 makes sense, it was solved
609 says to  (17:26:33):
but not the bests arent breke the code
609 says to  (17:26:40):
yes
609 says to  (17:26:59):
i ment the rest
woodenigloo says to  (17:27:03):
the 340 in my opinion is bogus, mumble jumble
609 says to  (17:27:43):
it must be because modern computers havent solve it
woodenigloo says to  (17:28:00):
I am in full agreement
609 says to  (17:28:57):
its still been "fun" to think what all the codes might be
woodenigloo says to  (17:29:37):
the "my name is" cipher has been solved in my opinion
609 says to  (17:30:00):
was it the short one?
609 says to  (17:31:15):
how this picture closes
609 says to  (17:31:18):
aa
609 says to  (17:31:30):
it stays there
609 says to  (17:31:51):
yes i ment that, what u think it mean
609 says to  (17:35:11):
can i ask, why u think gaikowski was zodiac
woodenigloo says to  (17:36:06):
too many reaons to list actually
609 says to  (17:36:15):
ok
VJ says to  (17:36:34):
Hello
609 says to  (17:36:46):

woodenigloo says to  (17:37:52):
yes, Bryans been submitted to the audio of Gyke
VJ says to  (17:38:32):
What did he say?
woodenigloo says to  (17:38:44):
he hasn't made any comment on it
VJ says to  (17:39:10):
So he must sense some similarities i suppose.
woodenigloo says to  (17:39:31):
I'm thinking that's probably the reason too

woodenigloo says to  (17:42:51):
very cohesive
609 says to  (17:49:30):
hi snooter
snooter says to  (17:49:49):
hey
609 says to  (17:50:01):
do u have a suspect
snooter says to  (17:51:15):
no...never have..
609 says to  (17:51:44):
have u tried to crack the code
snooter says to  (17:52:28):
no...no interest in the codes..sorry
609 says to  (17:53:22):
i have thinked all week and my head hurts :) got to stop it
snooter says to  (17:53:31):
but dont let me sway you from trying..
609 says to  (17:53:32):
addicting
snooter says to  (17:54:06):
it can consume you...i think time is better spent elsewhere..but thats just me
snooter says to  (17:54:42):
a lot of what is out there is theory..and thats a problem..
609 says to  (17:54:46):
i think if the best code brakers havent done it so what my chanses are ..
snooter says to  (17:57:45):
personally i would try to find any link Z had with riverside and CB...also i do entertain some thought on Z having ties with ferrin be it albany or in vallejo...
snooter says to  (17:58:31):
in regards to the code i am no sure they are solveable...but i am be surprised at some point
609 says to  (17:59:19):
are those wictims? sorry im so new at this (cb ferrin)

snooter says to  (17:59:45):
yes victims
609 says to  (18:00:28):
is gaikowski still alive
609 says to  (18:01:04):
did they do dna test on him
snooter says to  (18:01:18):
no..i believe deceased in 04
snooter says to  (18:01:37):
i do not remeber..wooden would know
snooter says to  (18:03:58):
narlow one time thought may be gaik was at the painting party with ferrin...there is also a book supposably in possession of gik at one time that was signed by stein...i dont rule out gaik and stein having knowledge of each other
woodenigloo says to  (18:04:33):
Gyke died in 2004 yes
woodenigloo says to  (18:04:53):
April 30th, 2004 iirc
woodenigloo says to  (18:05:24):
but born on Pi Day   3-14-1936
woodenigloo says to  (18:05:31):
3.14 = pi
woodenigloo says to  (18:06:33):
have a look at that, from the halloween Card
snooter says to  (18:06:59):
i only go as far as gaik and stein more than likely having knowledge of each other.
609 says to  (18:07:24):
were the 5 victims all in vallejo
woodenigloo says to  (18:07:34):
Carol Stine was in chat for several hours last night
woodenigloo says to  (18:07:45):
no,
woodenigloo says to  (18:07:53):
2 in Benecia
woodenigloo says to  (18:07:59):
2 in Vallejo
snooter says to  (18:07:59):
carol is interesting
609 says to  (18:08:04):
i look it up later
woodenigloo says to  (18:08:06):
2 in Napa at Lake berryesssa
woodenigloo says to  (18:08:13):
1 in San Francisco
609 says to  (18:08:28):
thx
woodenigloo says to  (18:08:35):
look at this image:
snooter says to  (18:08:44):
all 5 in close proximity or immediate geographical area
snooter says to  (18:10:10):
spooky
woodenigloo says to  (18:10:36):
gykes birthday
snooter says to  (18:11:10):
i think its fair assertion Z stayed close to home which is greater SF area..but i also think he moved from riverside..but thats just me
snooter says to  (18:12:04):
yea thats really spooky wood..never seen that before
609 says to  (18:12:56):
u sayed something about stine, is she related one of the victims
snooter says to  (18:13:23):
carol was pauls stines younger sister..she was in chat last night
woodenigloo says to  (18:13:29):
carol stine is the sister of murder victim Paul Stine
609 says to  (18:13:57):
ok, what she think all this
snooter says to  (18:14:11):
the bombshell of claudia and paul working for GT was interesting
snooter says to  (18:14:54):
carol thinks paul knew his killer,,,i believe that as well..
snooter says to  (18:15:34):
the gist of the matter is of course linking gaik to z and z to gaik and routed thru paul stine
snooter says to  (18:18:43):
paul was a brilliant person..working on his doctorate no less...i have entertained some thought paul was involved in the codes..but carol last night said he had no interest..it would tie Z as gaik with Z working with Paul on code development..but its a stretch with no proof ever to be found of course
snooter says to  (18:20:52):
i would like to know if paul ghost wrote some articles for good times..nutin ever been found that i am aware of
snooter says to  (18:22:28):
609 i am not a huge gaik fan..but some aspects of the Z case look interesting with gaik..
609 says to  (18:27:26):
so i have been looking this case just a week, so i dont have all the facts. i saw somewere that all zodiac investigations have been stopped, where can anyone tell they findings?
609 says to  (18:29:11):
i think i look more about gaikowski later
snooter says to  (18:30:30):
i dont think they are stopped but they are cold cases...its now 40plus years after the fact and a lot of those involved haved passed on
609 says to  (18:32:02):
yes, i red that they moved forses to other cases. but is there some plase u can tell findings
snooter says to  (18:32:29):
wooden has more info than me on that
snooter says to  (18:33:28):
may be do a search on this site for questions you have..i am sure somebody posted findings
609 says to  (18:34:19):
u mean in this chat
609 says to  (18:35:12):
sorry my english arent so good
snooter says to  (18:35:49):

could somewhat fit into society enough to get along probably had a wife kids or wifes they got older or moved closer or out etc
zodiaczavis says to  (19:01:31):
Hmm

No I think it has all been said and done already over the years.
zodiaczavis says to  (19:02:11):
So Given He Could Fit Into Society What Job Would He Have Had?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (19:02:57):
probably something like security guard type deal probably even applied for the police dept was turned down
zodiaczavis says to  (19:03:17):
Good Theory, He Was So Preoccupied With The Police Force
SerialProfilingFan says to  (19:03:17):
some type of job where he sensed he could be like someone in authority

What's Your Interest Into The Case?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (19:05:53):
bringing closure to the remaining familys Justice if u will perhaps one day something will turn up that will deffinatly say" here is the smoking gun so and so had this or that turn it into LE and they agree "yes this was the man who did this"

SHEER ZODIAC
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:52:37):
dig the name lol
VJ says to  (20:54:14):
I wish someone would confirm whether they found Paul Stine's glasses on the scene or if Zodiac took them(and wore them) in that case the Zodiac might not even wear glasses regularly.
*** (20:55:21):Rehab quit the room
tracers says to  (20:55:22):
I do not see zodiac taking the glasses  they would be all bloody
tracers says to  (20:55:55):
but who can say for sure
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:56:09):
 not to mention broke perhaps cause of the shot the blowback etc
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:56:39):
just speculation of course
tracers says to  (20:57:10):
I think zodiac did wear glasses  because he tried so hard in his letter  (was it the nov 8 letter?)  to convince the cops that he had been wearing a disguise that night
tracers says to  (20:57:38):
if zodiac had been wearing a disguise he would be better off not saying he was wearing one to mislead the cops
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:58:02):
and whats with the sunglass clip thing at lb?
VJ says to  (20:58:19):
Yeah i didn't get that either
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:58:20):
perhaps trying to hide that fact as well that he had on glasses underneath?
tracers says to  (20:58:28):
i think Foulke and Zlems did see Zodiac and he freaked out and tried to misdirect Law Enforcement (LE)
VJ says to  (20:58:41):
Well Bryan Hartnell didnt think he had glasses underneath i believe?
tracers says to  (20:58:49):
glasses underneath what?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:58:58):
the hood
VJ says to  (20:59:00):
At the LB attack.
tracers says to  (20:59:11):
yeah conflicting accounts of the lake b attacker and glasses
SerialProfilingFan says to  (21:01:55):
yeah

i don't think there are any official ones by tour companies
tracers says to  (02:17:49):
this past summer when I was out sandy and I took a guy from Finland or Norway to the Vallejo Zodiac sites
junkyardmary says to  (02:17:49):
Dumb question: Z tour means Zodiac right?
tracers says to  (02:17:54):
yes
junkyardmary says to  (02:18:06):

junkyardmary says to  (02:20:19):
That's AWESOMME--I wanna go!  And... sounds like a pretty cool career op for this Sandy person.  I'd totally pay for a tour. In money. And kindness.

So, Tracers, VJ & Dr. Nash--I take it u guys knew of Tom Voigt's work b4 Clyde Lewis last night?
VJ says to  (02:26:46):
Chat was good, had a couple of people interrogating Carol for a bit though.
tracers says to  (02:26:58):
yes I have been a chat and messageboard member since 2007
tracers says to  (02:28:01):
she did seem to contradict herself at times, but people were asking her so many questions all at once   she could have easily been confused at times  or was slow in responding so her answer may have been to a question asked earlier
tracers says to  (02:28:06):
she is around 69 now
tracers says to  (02:28:19):
and probably not used to chat rooms at all
junkyardmary says to  (02:28:31):
Plus she was prob trying 2 listen. It's a killer show!!
tracers says to  (02:28:37):
yes lol
junkyardmary says to  (02:28:54):
Hey, this Baby Hope article is super disturbing...

junkyardmary says to  (02:33:03):
Your article reminded me of the Clyde Lewis on Thurs., he was talkin abt the new evidence in the case of a young man whose body was exhumed 2 do a 2nd autopsy & his freakin ORGANS were all missing.  SO DISTURBING.  Oh dang.  I gots 2 do laundry
tracers says to  (02:33:03):
the killer sent a fake zodiac letter
tracers says to  (02:33:07):
in 2008 i think
Dr Nash says to  (02:33:22):
it was hard trying to mulitask listening to tom and reading what carol was saying. it was tricky

Dang, Tom dunn his homework, yo!! *IMPRESSED*
tracers says to  (02:37:48):
here is the thread about the case
tracers says to  (02:38:23):
bbinafew I am going to watch that show on IDTV
tracers says to  (02:38:47):
see if they mention he sent a fake zodiac letter
tracers says to  (02:39:03):
he also iirc made a zodiac crosshair sign on the mirror in lipstick
Dr Nash says to  (02:39:03):
i can't remember if she talked about the rumor her brother paul got a job with the chronical
tracers says to  (02:39:06):
bbinafew
andrew6979 says to  (02:39:32):
she did mention that a couple times in response to questions
VJ says to  (02:40:16):
I got the impression that Paul hadn't mentioned the job either to her or his brother. But Blaine actually told her that it was mentioned in the paper.
VJ says to  (02:43:12):
Whether it actually WAS in the paper or not has to be looked into, too bad they don't have Archives older then 95' online.
Dr Nash says to  (02:43:55):
true.
andrew6979 says to  (02:45:06):
Your're right, it has to be corroborated. But I was pretty impressed how detailed Blaine was with his research on Richard's Knickerbocker news articles -- every article I found by Gyke was on Blaine's list.
Dr Nash says to  (02:46:30):
hope blaine's doing well. haven't heard anything about him in a while
tracers says to  (02:51:08):
Me either.  But Ricardo might know, as he had published some of Blaine's writngs on his MK Zodiac site.

serialprofilingfan says to  (03:36:03):
ahhh yes the Touma case tried to blame it on zodiac not very smart lol
Dr Nash says to  (03:38:43):
it is a man who was affected when his sister got killed and rapped. he wanted jutsice. he imvetigates things like one close to me by a few hours is highway of tears or ear/ons. he looks into them he also has several contacts he relies on.  they are serial killer and or rapists. those people give their inside thoughts and perpectives on the person of interest  like why would he do something that way ect ect. he did ear this year it was good
tracers says to  (03:39:29):
ahh yes that guy with the frosted hair tips
tracers says to  (03:39:35):

andrew9760 says to  (03:54:07):
what did you guys think when Carol mentioned Paul and Claudia both working at an underground newspaper
Dr Nash says to  (03:55:22):
i thought it was good. how i think claudia was stine's wife or gf. common interest with doing newspapers.
andrew9760 says to  (03:55:51):
i think she meant the good times paper.
andrew9760 says to  (03:58:02):
because she said they worked at the same paper as one of Blaine's suspects.
woodenigloo says to  (04:00:25):
hi ya judith
Dr Nash says to  (04:01:22):
andrew did carol mention anything about good times? i am trying to remember'hey wood
andrew9760 says to  (04:01:22):
hey wood
woodenigloo says to  (04:01:22):
hi dr nash and drew too!!
andrew9760 says to  (04:01:22):
she didn't mention it by name but she did say they worked at the same paper as one of Blaine's suspects
andrew9760 says to  (04:01:22):
so i just deduced that it was good times
Dr Nash says to  (04:01:40):
it was good times. perhaps before it became good times. as it was the san fran express
andrew9760 says to  (04:01:45):
I was stunned when she revealed this information
andrew9760 says to  (04:03:34):
right
judith says to  (04:03:34):
Carol did say they could walk to the paper
judith says to  (04:03:34):
walking distance
andrew9760 says to  (04:03:34):
yes
andrew9760 says to  (04:03:34):
that sounds like it to me.
judith says to  (04:03:34):
going to have to lurk for few... brb
woodenigloo says to  (04:03:34):
hi again judith
Dr Nash says to  (04:03:34):
it sounds like it
Dr Nash says to  (04:03:38):
only thing to me to take it to cloud nine. if it was z task force meeting  rented out spot. see her. and hear the raw enotion in her voice recounting her everything. that would be something
andrew9760 says to  (04:04:40):
did she ever report the car incident to the police?
andrew9760 says to  (04:04:52):
for some reason i'm thinking she didn't.
Dr Nash says to  (04:08:45):
not sure. but damn. if i was in carol's shoes. after that and read about jones. i would be close to heart attack like. going shit that could been me
andrew9760 says to  (04:09:13):
I know.
andrew9760 says to  (04:09:24):
she made that drive like once a month. he must have scouted her routine.
Dr Nash says to  (04:13:02):
indeed. andrew do you remember when joe challenged z in turlock and when kathlen jones occured?
Dr Nash says to  (04:14:21):
march 22 1970 for z for kj if i am not mistaken
andrew9760 says to  (04:14:24):
not off the bat
andrew9760 says to  (04:15:30):
ill have to look that one up
Dr Nash says to  (04:15:46):
i remembered. oct 23 69
andrew9760 says to  (04:16:02):
good memory there.
andrew9760 says to  (04:16:20):
now i see why you have an advanced degree lol
Dr Nash says to  (04:16:20):
so z or gyke had a several months of stalking. getting to know the routine
Dr Nash says to  (04:16:20):
lol
andrew9760 says to  (04:16:32):
makes sense yeah
Dr Nash says to  (04:16:54):
my memory is still god not to metion how many conussions i have. not to mentioned dealing with post for a while.
andrew9760 says to  (04:17:02):
yes, it makes sense that it would happen several months after the challenge
andrew9760 says to  (04:17:20):
ah ok
Dr Nash says to  (04:17:48):
plus if z was gyke. the switchboard was by the stine place.  gyke would see carol leave on a certain day piror to paul being killed.
andrew9760 says to  (04:18:30):
never thought of that
andrew9760 says to  (04:19:13):
wait, carol didn't live near there did she?
andrew9760 says to  (04:19:25):
i thought it was just paul and his wife.

Dr Nash says to  (04:22:54):
i am not sure. judith or trac could correct me. i  think i am right.  i know she reconized gyke.. she had to seen him a bunch
andrew9760 says to  (04:24:22):
ii think it's entirely plausible gyke could have learned about carol's visits if he and paul knew each other through the Good Times paper.
andrew9760 says to  (04:24:36):
casual convo or something
andrew9760 says to  (04:26:13):

judith says to  (04:28:36):
not impossible but I would never describe it as "walking distance"
andrew9760 says to  (04:28:36):
right.
andrew9760 says to  (04:29:13):
but yes, the switchboard does make sense
Dr Nash says to  (04:29:13):
sadly every time i hear walking distance i think of greysmith..:(
Dr Nash says to  (04:29:13):
it had to been god times
Dr Nash says to  (04:29:19):
(good
andrew9760 says to  (04:29:26):
yeah
judith says to  (04:29:28):
remember that Carol is certainly not as versed in the details of the case as many of us are
Frank Boling says to  (04:29:35):
Judith did anyone ever hear anymore about Pauls glasses,i know someone said they were found but Carol said she did not believe that to be true
andrew9760 says to  (04:29:52):
good point, Judith.
judith says to  (04:30:07):
someone said they thought Toschi had said they were crumpled under Paul's body
andrew9760 says to  (04:30:14):
Has Tom delved into this possible GT connection at all?
judith says to  (04:30:15):
Carol said she had not heard that
judith says to  (04:30:42):
I don't believe so drew.. last night was the first I had heard of it myself
andrew9760 says to  (04:30:51):
ok
judith says to  (04:30:51):
didn't you hear me fall off my chair?
Dr Nash says to  (04:30:51):
not sure about last night. i think it was asked. i think z was nt wearing oaul's glasses. they would been covered in blood.  pretty dead give away something is off about this person wearing blood stained glasses
andrew9760 says to  (04:31:01):
i did , the same moment my jaw hit the floor lol
Frank Boling says to  (04:31:10):
Judith has Tom or anyone ever tried to get dave Toschi in the chat/
judith says to  (04:31:12):
Z could have been wearing his own glasses
judith says to  (04:31:36):
Carol also said that Claudia received all the personal items from the morgue
judith says to  (04:31:59):
and that Claudia has not spoken with the family since the funeral
serialprofilingfan says to  (04:32:01):
and she aint talking
andrew9760 says to  (04:32:08):
weird
serialprofilingfan says to  (04:32:10):
never has imo
Dr Nash says to  (04:32:10):
i think toshi doesn;t midn talking about it. however it does bother him he couldnt get his man
judith says to  (04:32:16):
but according to the coroner's report there were no glasses listed
serialprofilingfan says to  (04:32:56):
I dont buy the "z took and wore stines glasses" they would be scripted
judith says to  (04:32:56):
Frank, I don't know re Toschi
Frank Boling says to  (04:32:56):
ok
judith says to  (04:32:56):
agreed Spf
andrew9760 says to  (04:32:56):
agree SPF
andrew9760 says to  (04:32:56):
lol
judith says to  (04:33:13):
if he were wearing glasses they were his own, imo
serialprofilingfan says to  (04:33:13):
if he did that they woulda deffinatly caught him u can imagine trying to walk with someones script like that
serialprofilingfan says to  (04:33:13):
yup
andrew9760 says to  (04:33:32):
I think he would be too worried about getting the hell out of there
serialprofilingfan says to  (04:33:32):
he already took some trophys
Dr Nash says to  (04:33:32):
i think many people asked armstrong and he said no. he does not even want to talk about it. i cold be wrong
serialprofilingfan says to  (04:33:40):
but who knows.
Dr Nash says to  (04:34:14):
hecould take it as a trophy like paul's book
judith says to  (04:34:14):
maybe he had his prints on them, just like the key?
serialprofilingfan says to  (04:34:14):
i believe carol said as well that PS would not let anyone get in the front seat
judith says to  (04:34:14):
and that was why they were taken?
andrew9760 says to  (04:34:16):
yes, i remember thta as well.
judith says to  (04:34:17):
except a friend
serialprofilingfan says to  (04:34:20):
I still say z was in the back seat
*** (04:34:49):Welcome to ZODIACKILLER.COM CHAT , neenzy!
serialprofilingfan says to  (04:34:49):
the only reason he was up front was when he went in and got the wallet n keys
judith says to  (04:34:49):
that he was trusting that way
serialprofilingfan says to  (04:34:49):

Frank Boling says to  (04:35:23):
Judith yes so sad for Carol
neenzy says to  (04:35:40):
i thought it was really interesting all arond
Dr Nash says to  (04:35:40):
if i saw carol. or anyone saw carol. i think we would have given her a big hug.
neenzy says to  (04:35:49):
around*
andrew9760 says to  (04:35:53):
it was, the chat combined with the radio show and Tom.
Frank Boling says to  (04:35:53):
Dr yes true
judith says to  (04:36:08):
was difficult to keep up with it all
andrew9760 says to  (04:36:38):
i didn't realized that tom had been on for four hours.
serialprofilingfan says to  (04:36:45):
now u can imagine the old days! over 200 chatters
neenzy says to  (04:36:50):

jude you are never a mess lol
judith says to  (04:37:33):
ha, ty
Dr Nash says to  (04:37:36):
i listened. i just wish the comerical for news or traffic updates would not be as long as hearing tom talk. i would love it to be uninterupted in a perfect world. but that wouldn't happen
andrew9760 says to  (04:38:07):
i thought women are good at mutlitasking lol
judith says to  (04:38:20):
well drew I didn't spill my wine when I fell off my chair... does that count?
andrew9760 says to  (04:38:23):
yes it does lol
Dr Nash says to  (04:38:28):
what type of wine judith? (i work at winery)
judith says to  (04:38:30):
Trace asked some great questions too
judith says to  (04:38:35):

andrew9760 says to  (04:39:03):
it's nice that the commericals are gone from the podcast
Frank Boling says to  (04:40:05):
DR sounds like a very interesting job....
neenzy says to  (04:40:05):
andrew - really?? good to know - now I will have to listen!
andrew9760 says to  (04:40:06):
yep
judith says to  (04:40:06):
oh meant to say re the incident... ties in with Z's "you won't get the bad news for a while", something like that
andrew9760 says to  (04:40:06):
ah ok
judith says to  (04:40:26):
my opinion only but I think he was planning that attack on Carol after Joe put out his show down
Frank Boling says to  (04:40:40):
Judith,yes I agree..
judith says to  (04:40:44):
and started stalking her then
andrew9760 says to  (04:40:45):
Yes, Judith, that was what Dr. Nash and i agreed on
judith says to  (04:40:58):
oh ok, sorry wasn't here
andrew9760 says to  (04:41:37):
oh i'm just saying we agree with your sentiments
judith says to  (04:41:40):
np, gotcha
judith says to  (04:42:06):
Trace had some good questions for her as well
andrew9760 says to  (04:42:12):
yes.
judith says to  (04:42:24):
I think she opened the door for Carol to talk about when/where they met, etc
neenzy says to  (04:42:31):
you both had good questions in my limited knowledge :)
andrew9760 says to  (04:42:31):
that was big.
judith says to  (04:42:41):
and that is when DMV and underground newspaper came up
andrew9760 says to  (04:42:47):
one of hte key questions
judith says to  (04:42:53):
yeah drew it was BIG
judith says to  (04:42:57):
ty neen
andrew9760 says to  (04:43:15):
i was like how in the world had we never heard this stuff before.
judith says to  (04:43:15):
yep
judith says to  (04:43:35):
and I still have to wonder why Carol has not made a connection
neenzy says to  (04:44:20):
I thought so too - cause jude was all over it :)
*** (04:44:20):Welcome to ZODIACKILLER.COM CHAT , pax!
judith says to  (04:44:20):
perhaps she thought le was handling it all, idk
judith says to  (05:13:47):
so about 5 years ago (?) I spoke with someone who was childhood friends with a young man who was a neighbor across the street on Cherry from the crime scene
serialprofilingfan says to  (05:13:47):
freaking z I had a lil theory a while back that was dealing with the old norse stuff or maybe some other group about the "Trees" various trees represent things
serialprofilingfan says to  (05:13:47):
like with the water theory lol
serialprofilingfan says to  (05:13:51):
Pine!!!
serialprofilingfan says to  (05:13:51):
Maple
judith says to  (05:13:51):
do you remember how Fouke stated in the director's cut that he and Zelms were responding to a "shot fired" ?
serialprofilingfan says to  (05:13:51):
cheeryyyy
andrew9760 says to  (05:13:54):
yes, Judith.
serialprofilingfan says to  (05:14:03):
yup
snooter says to  (05:14:03):
my only theory..paul wrote the codes or helped..but after last night that theory is bunk
judith says to  (05:14:25):
the kids that first placed the call did NOT report hearing a shot fired
Frank Boling says to  (05:14:32):
Is Pine ST a bad area??
snooter says to  (05:14:54):
doubtful they would if muffled inside a car and windows closed
judith says to  (05:14:56):
this young man heard a single shot and told his father (not sure if father heard it as well) and call it in
judith says to  (05:15:23):
I believe that was the call Fouke was initially responding to
andrew9760 says to  (05:15:25):
very interesting
neenzy says to  (05:15:25):
very!
judith says to  (05:15:33):
Father was politically savvy enough to keep it out of the papers
andrew9760 says to  (05:15:46):
prob. didn't want to be hounded
serialprofilingfan says to  (05:16:06):
also something had to get the teens attention to look out too
andrew9760 says to  (05:16:10):
I remember reading somewhere on the internet about a person hearing a gunshot in the neighborhood
andrew9760 says to  (05:16:27):
tried to find the article again but couldn't
judith says to  (05:18:46):
this would have been the view from their home
andrew9760 says to  (05:18:46):
maybe the acoustics were a lot better at ground level
judith says to  (05:18:46):
it was a warm evening for SF
judith says to  (05:18:47):
plus the house you are looking at has a long concrete retaining wall heading towards Jackson St
judith says to  (05:18:47):
I've not posted this on mb as the young man (now an adult) does not want to become involved
judith says to  (05:18:47):
and I can completely understand that
*** (05:18:47):Welcome to ZODIACKILLER.COM CHAT , ekas1!
andrew9760 says to  (05:18:47):
could the "black male story" have been invented to give fouke and zelms cover?
Frank Boling says to  (05:19:02):
Judith do you know if Paul was wearing a cap when he was shot??
judith says to  (05:19:02):
no hat afaik
judith says to  (05:19:03):
no hat, cap, etc
Frank Boling says to  (05:19:10):
oh ok
neenzy says to  (05:21:49):
what about what drew said?
judith says to  (05:21:49):
madris shirt and lightweigh windbreaker
andrew9760 says to  (05:21:49):
i've wondered that.
judith says to  (05:21:49):
warm evening
*** (05:21:49):ekas1 quit the room
judith says to  (05:21:49):
"black male" my opinion only I think the kids and the dispatcher were talking over one another and kid may have said "black" in his description of  jacket Z was wearing
neenzy says to  (05:21:49):
ahh ok ty
judith says to  (05:21:50):
and dispatcher misheard
judith says to  (05:21:50):
obviously idk
serialprofilingfan says to  (05:21:50):
yeah u do CONFESS
andrew9760 says to  (05:22:09):
that easily could have happened
judith says to  (05:22:09):
hahaha
judith says to  (05:22:09):
never
serialprofilingfan says to  (05:22:09):
lol
judith says to  (05:22:09):
never to spf
tracers says to  (05:22:09):
iiirc Fouke may have said it was a shots fired
tracers says to  (05:22:09):
or that Senkeir guy
judith says to  (05:22:09):
shot
andrew9760 says to  (05:22:10):
i still think Z was way too close to the scene not to have been questioned, however briefly, by the cops.
tracers says to  (05:22:10):
one cop in some article did say it was a shots fired
judith says to  (05:22:10):
I've never seen that Trace
tracers says to  (05:22:10):
or did fouke say that on durector's cut?  I can't recall now
judith says to  (05:22:10):
director's cut
neenzy says to  (05:25:01):
hey trace!
tracers says to  (05:25:16):
Drew,as far as some retired LE saying things about the stine scene not posted before, was that JDEAn?  He was that retired LE who was/is part of Lafferty's team
tracers says to  (05:25:16):
i recall he said a number of things--not sure if true or not
andrew9760 says to  (05:25:16):
for example, like one of the teens actually going out of hte house
tracers says to  (05:25:16):
hi Neen!
andrew9760 says to  (05:25:30):
and walking after Z a bit to see where he was headed
tracers says to  (05:25:30):
i know Jdean had posted at the old Morf board
judith says to  (05:25:30):
"responding to a shooting @ Cherry & Washington"... Fouke from director's cut
andrew9760 says to  (05:25:30):
ok, maybe that was him.
tracers says to  (05:25:30):
not sure if what he posted got transferred to the new board
tracers says to  (05:25:30):
ok well I think maybe it was in that article  some Senkeir guy
andrew9760 says to  (05:25:30):
he also mentioned that Z was trying to prop Sine up into a sitting position
tracers says to  (05:25:31):
ok thanks  i get mixed up at times
andrew9760 says to  (05:25:31):
np
Frank Boling says to  (05:25:31):
This guy Gyke was never even made mention of in the 2007 movie was he??
tracers says to  (05:25:31):
so many different versions
andrew9760 says to  (05:25:31):
no, he wasn't
judith says to  (05:25:31):
no Frank
Frank Boling says to  (05:25:35):
TY
judith says to  (05:26:53):
the movie was Graysmith's baby
neenzy says to  (05:26:53):
yup
Frank Boling says to  (05:26:53):
Jude oh ok
andrew9760 says to  (05:26:53):
that one call by the woman who knew gyke back in south dakota was interesting.
Frank Boling says to  (05:26:53):
only watched part of the movie back few months ago...
judith says to  (05:26:53):
seemed a bit pat to me
andrew9760 says to  (05:26:53):
"something a bit off" about him
judith says to  (05:27:04):
but I had a horrid echo so not sure of her timeline
andrew9760 says to  (05:27:34):
she was like, even his friends thought there was somedthign odd about him
andrew9760 says to  (05:27:51):
it reminded me of Cat Yronde's take on gyke
judith says to  (05:27:51):
does anyone remember when she said she knew Richard and when he was talking about hippies in CA etc?
Frank Boling says to  (05:27:51):
Is the 911 op who talked to Z after one of the murders still alive??
andrew9760 says to  (05:27:55):
yes,
andrew9760 says to  (05:28:25):
she said he wanted to get out to california as soon as possible because that's where they were
judith says to  (05:28:25):
Nancy Slover from BRS?
judith says to  (05:28:25):
Nancy has passed
judith says to  (05:28:25):
terrific gal
neenzy says to  (05:28:36):
yes she was :)
Frank Boling says to  (05:29:27):
oh ok
judith says to  (05:29:27):
drew, did she say when those conversations took place?
andrew9760 says to  (05:29:27):
she never said exactly
andrew9760 says to  (05:29:27):
but she seemed to perk up when tom mentioned his college name
andrew9760 says to  (05:33:13):
maybe when they were in college
tracers says to  (05:33:13):
drew, do you recall what the LE  guy at Morf's said about Stine case that you had never heard before?
judith says to  (05:33:15):
my concern is that all the hoopla about hippies didn't really hit national/international attention til about '65 to '66 earliest
serialprofilingfan says to  (05:33:15):
she sounded legit to me judith
judith says to  (05:33:15):
and he was already here
tracers says to  (05:33:57):
bbiam
serialprofilingfan says to  (05:33:57):
it would be interesting if she contacts tom
andrew9760 says to  (05:33:57):
i was wondering about that too Judith, but agree with SPF, she did sound legit.
Frank Boling says to  (05:33:57):
Ok I see now just passed little more then a year ago,may2012
Frank Boling says to  (05:33:57):
nancy that is
andrew9760 says to  (05:33:57):
Trace, that guy said Zodiac tried several times to prop up Stine in the seat but was unsuccessful
judith says to  (05:33:57):
Nancy was a terrific gal and could drink anyone here under the table
neenzy says to  (05:33:58):
frank - several of us went to her funeral that live here
neenzy says to  (05:33:58):
jude - over/under and still be coherent!
andrew9760 says to  (05:33:58):
he also said the reason the kids could see everything so well was that cabbies usually removed the covers on their interior dome lights
Frank Boling says to  (05:33:58):
Neen i see
judith says to  (05:33:58):
yep neen, lol
judith says to  (05:33:58):
ah to make change etc I bet
serialprofilingfan says to  (05:33:59):
sigh Nancy was so kool
andrew9760 says to  (05:33:59):
he also said one of the kids actually went out of the house to see where Z was headed.
judith says to  (05:34:33):
1st responder to the scene (Pellesitti ?) said when he got there the kids were out of the house and heading to the cab
judith says to  (05:34:33):
that he herded them back home
andrew9760 says to  (05:34:33):

andrew9760 says to  (05:42:41):

Angie says to  (05:44:15):

tracers says to  (05:45:11):
and then check your "other" messages on facebook and see if anyone responds?
Frank Boling says to  (05:45:34):
Trace great idea!
andrew9760 says to  (05:49:08):

judith says to  (05:53:09):
Group 3 could be a potential option drew
judith says to  (05:53:31):
I've bookmarked it
andrew9760 says to  (05:53:36):
right.
andrew9760 says to  (05:54:07):
We know Z wore glasses, so the misspellings could easily have been unintentional
judith says to  (05:54:23):
that's a really interesting take on it
judith says to  (05:54:47):
had not realized visual problems could cause such spelling erros
judith says to  (05:54:49):
errors, lol
Rehab says to  (05:54:56):
bad vision plus only one eye
andrew9760 says to  (05:54:58):
i hadn't really either until i read that
tracers says to  (05:55:18):
one eye?
andrew9760 says to  (05:55:19):
like Zodiac seemed consistent with some of his errors
andrew9760 says to  (05:55:40):
like the double "s"
judith says to  (05:55:40):
could explain the extremely large glasses
judith says to  (05:55:41):
blind in one eye Trace
judith says to  (05:55:41):
left eye
judith says to  (05:56:00):
probably why he hit the pedestrian first day on job
judith says to  (05:56:45):
the double ss in that image ... hmmm
andrew9760 says to  (05:57:13):
yeah i was like, that looks familiar
tracers says to  (05:57:58):
ah ok
judith says to  (05:59:19):
great find drew!
andrew9760 says to  (05:59:19):
if you account for the spelling errors, there aren't any other mistakes -- no grammatical errors or anything
andrew9760 says to  (05:59:19):
ty
Rehab says to  (06:04:07):
yess, tyvm, good read
judith says to  (06:04:07):

andrew9760 says to  (06:04:07):
yw
judith says to  (06:04:07):
drew you should post that on the mb
Rehab says to  (06:04:07):
agreed
judith says to  (06:04:07):
I don't which thread would be the best though
andrew9760 says to  (06:04:07):
Ok, as part of a thread or on its own
judith says to  (06:04:07):
on it's own I think
judith says to  (06:04:07):
but ask the boss
andrew9760 says to  (06:04:25):
actually, there is one thread titles something like poor speller?
judith says to  (06:04:25):
YESS, lol
andrew9760 says to  (06:04:25):
for ssure
judith says to  (06:04:25):
no, lol... I think that is the thread title "Poor speller? YESS" something like that
tracers says to  (06:04:25):
i think so too  judith
judith says to  (06:04:25):
about his application
*** (06:04:25):pax quit the room
andrew9760 says to  (06:04:40):
yes, originally about the application
andrew9760 says to  (06:04:40):
good memory there.
judith says to  (06:04:40):
but that was specific to Richard... this link could be for Z?
andrew9760 says to  (06:05:33):
ahh ok
judith says to  (06:05:33):
either, I don't care
tracers says to  (06:05:43):

judith says to  (06:06:50):
ty drew.. it is a very cool find
andrew9760 says to  (06:06:50):
that's it.
andrew9760 says to  (06:06:51):

tracers says to  (06:07:27):
ok
judith says to  (06:07:51):
of course I think it ties in nicely with Richard, but could apply to anyone else with eye problems
andrew9760 says to  (06:07:51):
i know there has been speculation that Z spelled words incorrectly on purpose
andrew9760 says to  (06:08:08):
but this shows that might not be the case
judith says to  (06:08:08):
I've thought that myself
judith says to  (06:08:24):
yess, you have me rethinking that
judith says to  (06:08:33):
will read the article again in am
andrew9760 says to  (06:08:33):
always willing to help a noob.
judith says to  (06:08:42):

andrew9760 says to  (06:09:32):

judith says to  (06:13:47):
deserves attention imo
tracers says to  (06:13:47):
bbiam
andrew9760 says to  (06:13:48):
it would be interesting to get an eye doctor's take on z's letters.
judith says to  (06:13:48):
send copies of letters to home of that link?
judith says to  (06:26:03):
or that study
andrew9760 says to  (06:26:03):
right right
andrew9760 says to  (06:26:03):
oh, something else of interest
andrew9760 says to  (06:26:04):
last Thursday, I attended a presentation of the troubles in Ireland
judith says to  (06:26:04):
wow
andrew9760 says to  (06:28:00):
and the guy mentioned some names and events from around the time gyke was allegedly there
tracers says to  (06:28:00):
ahhh
andrew9760 says to  (06:28:00):
andi 'm going to email him and see if he can look at the article and get his take
judith says to  (06:28:00):
was he a drunken Irishman with an eyepatch?
andrew9760 says to  (06:28:00):
his father was also a well known photographer
andrew9760 says to  (06:28:00):
rofl
andrew9760 says to  (06:28:00):
but i'm thinking he and his contacts and/or his father's contacts could give a good analysis of that gyke article
andrew9760 says to  (06:28:00):
actually two of them.
judith says to  (06:28:01):
you are just the little engine that could lately drew
judith says to  (06:28:01):
you never stop
andrew9760 says to  (06:29:44):
yeah, every week my local library does a presentation, and as soon as i saw that the one was on Ireland, I knew i had to go.
andrew9760 says to  (06:29:44):
ahah thanks
andrew9760 says to  (06:29:45):
i mean, what perfect timing.
andrew9760 says to  (06:29:45):
the thing was that i knew almost everything he was talking about from my prior research lol
judith says to  (06:29:45):
did you ever hear back from husband of woman who actually wrote original article for The Guardian?
andrew9760 says to  (06:29:45):
I never did.
judith says to  (06:29:45):
strange
judith says to  (06:29:45):
hasn't slowed you down though
andrew9760 says to  (06:35:14):
i know. i sent my email twice.
andrew9760 says to  (06:35:15):
My mom's friend at The Guardian said the plagiarism was very odd
neenzy says to  (06:35:15):
drew - wish you could get confirmation of email opened huh!  I can only do that with work emails
andrew9760 says to  (06:35:15):
yeah, i know.
andrew9760 says to  (06:35:15):
he said gyke should have gotten 5 years for the plagiarism alone lol
judith says to  (06:35:15):
(I think that article was a cover story for "out of the country")
andrew9760 says to  (06:35:15):
yes
andrew9760 says to  (06:35:15):

I don't think so

me either
snooter says to  (06:55:28):
how does lass tie in to paul?
Rehab says to  (06:56:14):
gonna start plugging the 45th anniversary LHR chat soon
judith says to  (06:56:15):
I'm not aware of any connection there snooter
Rehab says to  (06:56:15):
I didn't know about Paul and the Good Times
snooter says to  (06:56:15):
me neither..thought i seen something up above
neenzy says to  (06:56:24):
wow...see? I thought Tom knew all of tis

i question paul and claudia working for GT..
judith says to  (06:56:55):
Tom don't you think Carol assumed Swithboard was newspaper?
judith says to  (06:57:24):
she said "within walking distance"
judith says to  (06:58:05):
snooter I think she may have meant down the street from Paul's house @ Switchboard
tracers says to  (06:58:05):
well sometimes you remeber things at different times based on the questions asked
judith says to  (06:58:18):
yep Trace, true
tracers says to  (06:58:30):
i doubt tom would bother asking her how paul and Claudia met
judith says to  (06:58:35):
The Switchboard did work closely with the GT's
snooter says to  (06:58:37):
switchboard i can believe as possible..being neighbors and all
tracers says to  (06:58:41):
i was intersted in the personal stuff  lol
tracers says to  (06:58:43):
being a romantic
judith says to  (06:58:57):
that was the question that opened the doors Trace
Rehab says to  (06:58:59):
I just don't think Carol is up on Gaikowski's background, so I am not surprised she has learned something recently
neenzy says to  (06:58:59):
me too trace
tracers says to  (06:59:16):
yeah that was odd oh they met a dmv and worked together at a paper

the guy who says Grant was z mis states information and makes many errors and has no evidence
SteveUK says to  (10:02:24):

609/Cadoiz/VJ... are you guys still idle from last night?
609 says to  (18:09:56):
hi, whats idle
judith says to  (18:10:16):
means sitting and watching... not chatting
judith says to  (18:10:53):
you were all in here when I left late last evening
judith says to  (18:11:00):
and not chatting
609 says to  (18:11:30):
im new here so i dont have mutch to say
judith says to  (18:11:55):
that's ok, but I would encourage you to type something once in a while
judith says to  (18:12:03):
even a lol or something
609 says to  (18:12:12):
:)
judith says to  (18:12:16):
otherwise it seems a little like eavesdropping
judith says to  (18:12:31):
and someone might just boot you unnecessarily
judith says to  (18:12:58):
have you learned anything of interest since you been here?
609 says to  (18:14:08):
not much, just a week ago i started reading about z
judith says to  (18:14:31):
you've a lot to consider then
609 says to  (18:15:04):
yes, im mostly interested about the codes
judith says to  (18:15:20):
hmm
judith says to  (18:15:20):
I'm weak on codes
609 says to  (18:16:09):
me too :) still they interest me
judith says to  (18:16:38):
I got lost in them for a few months a couple of years ago and gave up
609 says to  (18:17:56):
i think the best codebrakers have tried, so...
judith says to  (18:18:58):
makes me think they are not true ciphers/codes
VJ says to  (18:19:07):
You're not giving me the ol' boot are you Judith? :D
judith says to  (18:19:09):
just have clues hidden in there
judith says to  (18:19:15):
not if you chat VJ, lol
609 says to  (18:19:35):
i think so too
judith says to  (18:19:52):
if you keep posting those bouncing evil smiley faces I might though
VJ says to  (18:20:43):
Watch it repeat, and repeat, ha ha.
judith says to  (18:21:17):
nah, there is an erase chat option... second from right at top of screen
judith says to  (18:22:08):
have we chatted before VJ?
VJ says to  (18:22:47):
I dont know, i was here a couple of years ago 08 i think.
judith says to  (18:23:05):
ok, I just didn't remember... sorry

SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:24:56):
nancy tried to get me to go somewhere fuck that
judith says to  (18:25:02):
hahahaha
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:25:12):
I have no time for the word
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:25:20):
I must research!!!
VJ says to  (18:25:23):
Must have been worrying living there.
judith says to  (18:25:25):
got your tail feathers ruffled this day do ya?
judith says to  (18:25:41):
quite frightening VJ
judith says to  (18:25:50):
shocking
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:25:55):
hahah trying to find that email from the one guy who sent me some info that was interesting
judith says to  (18:26:08):
oh about Jenner?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:26:16):
yup
judith says to  (18:26:18):
very interesting
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:26:50):
u know i got to thinking ..switching back to Zodiac ..what carol said about the guy trying to stop her and that the car looked like a state vehicle
judith says to  (18:26:54):
Cadoiz, you here?
judith says to  (18:27:03):
uh huh
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:28:04):
again back to the theory of z being some type of park ranger ..but im thinking what if this guy did some type of park maint driving from various parks i am wondering if there was such a person "persons" obviously since the system is so huge
judith says to  (18:28:24):
interesting question
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:28:36):
but yeah he would not be in a position where he had to really deal with visitors directly as I think this guy is a semi loner
judith says to  (18:28:56):
like an inspector of sorts?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:29:37):
yes or maint i would lean towards more of a background job .
judith says to  (18:30:05):
maintainence would most like have a truck or van
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:30:18):
the problem being shit theres so many state parks buti thought it interesting she worked at a park so did stine
judith says to  (18:30:21):
I think she said 4 door sedan
judith says to  (18:30:49):
LB & BRS are parks aren't they?
judith says to  (18:31:13):
perhaps not state parks though
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:31:16):
kings canyon and others all along that area where johns and carol said that incident happend and btw she said she never reported it !
judith says to  (18:31:44):
no SPF, she never answered that question
judith says to  (18:31:50):
didn't say she never reported it iirc
judith says to  (18:32:19):
I asked her, but do not recall she responded to my question
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:32:25):
LB is not sure where it falls under what org BRS falls under but there are others in the area thats the thing its so general shit i t would be like trying to find a needle in the haystack
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:32:41):
yeah talked to her through email she did nto report it !
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:32:53):
she needs to report it so it can be on record
judith says to  (18:32:55):
yess, that's true re "needle"
judith says to  (18:33:50):
might be a good idea to have Tom post something re follow up questions/clarifications from her
judith says to  (18:34:26):
she also never said the Chronicle story was a "rumour"
judith says to  (18:34:41):
I think Shawn had asked her if it was one
judith says to  (18:34:54):
she didn't answer and then the topic was brought up later
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:35:09):
she also said she was going by what she was told I think she was getting confused so many questions were being thrown her way
judith says to  (18:35:11):
and somehow confused that she had said it was a rumour
judith says to  (18:35:20):
exactly spf
VJ says to  (18:35:34):
Hmm Judith, i do remember he mentioning rumour.
VJ says to  (18:35:41):
her*
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:35:43):
and its no big shocker for me if gaik worked other papers too
judith says to  (18:35:44):
poor thing she couldn't keep up .... she was getting slammed
judith says to  (18:35:57):
she did not say "rumour"
judith says to  (18:36:09):
Shawn I believe said that
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:36:09):
the whole underground scene i would imagine they all helped out eachother from time to time
judith says to  (18:36:16):
of yess spf
VJ says to  (18:36:27):
"I thought it was just a rumor" i'm pretty sure she said that.
judith says to  (18:36:37):
I don't think so
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:36:39):
im too lazy to look but what types of vehicles did rg own or use?
judith says to  (18:37:14):
would be fine with being proven wrong VJ, but I don't think she used that word... Shawn asked her that
VJ says to  (18:38:09):
It's no big deal, i just got the impression Blaine told her that he had seen it in the paper?
judith says to  (18:38:36):
he was reported by Blaine to have had an old Studebaker... think Bates
judith says to  (18:39:09):
The commune shared vehicles afaik
judith says to  (18:39:42):
he also had a karmen ghia (?)
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:39:42):
yeah interesting
judith says to  (18:39:51):
I think that info was from Richard's mother
judith says to  (18:40:15):
I would have to check Blaine's notes to confirm
judith says to  (18:41:52):
yes VJ, you are correct... I think she did say it was in the paper but that is a long stretch from her having said it was a rumor
judith says to  (18:42:23):
she also said that Joe knew but she was surprised as Paul had told family he was heading to BC for study @ Thanksgiving time
VJ says to  (18:43:00):
I ment that originally she thought of it as a rumor until Blaine told her it was in the papers.
VJ says to  (18:43:19):
She was really being bombarded for a while.
VJ says to  (18:43:52):
It doesn't really matter since if it was in the papers that can be confirmed.
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:44:27):
I think it`s interesting about the yosemite stuff given that the det. and inspt. we have talked to asked a few times about the sierra club thing they seemed interested in that i bet they have more stuff dealing with something in that regards I.E. state parks or clubs like that and its not just that the one known perhaps z thing which iirc the sierra club letter
judith says to  (18:44:56):
I can't speak for her but my impression was that in 1969 the entire family may not have heard of it and that it wasn't until years later it was confirmed for her??????
judith says to  (18:45:12):
that's what I took away from the scattered questions and answers
judith says to  (18:45:37):
good point spf
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:46:15):
but man if its in the end a fact that claudia n paul in some way dealt with that underground zine and was close by there shit coincidence??
judith says to  (18:46:34):
knocked me off my chair when she said that
VJ says to  (18:46:48):
The Haight  Ashbury underground paper you mean?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:46:50):
yup
judith says to  (18:47:04):
that's why drew, trace & I asked her so many times to confirm what she had said
judith says to  (18:48:13):
Cadoiz?
VJ says to  (18:48:22):
I wonder if Gaikowski knew Paul and had a mutual  interested towards Claudia, maybe he finding out Paul got a job at SF Chronicle drove him over the edge.
judith says to  (18:48:59):
no way to answer that one VJ
judith says to  (18:49:57):
so it dawned on me this morning that she must have been talking about the Switchboard 2 houses away when she said "walking distance" as the commune on Bush St didn't happen until after Paul's murder
judith says to  (18:50:17):
Howard St would have been too far to walk as well
judith says to  (18:50:31):
she said close to their house
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:50:31):
she mentioned a church too
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:50:40):
on o`farrell
judith says to  (18:50:49):
I missed that
judith says to  (18:50:54):
what did she say?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:51:03):
but i cant remember in what context that was
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:51:09):
the funeral maybe
judith says to  (18:51:18):
oh yeah, maybe
judith says to  (18:51:39):
I was disconnected for a short time
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:51:43):
i was just curious where it was located guess i would have to look at the board
judith says to  (18:52:08):
several nice churches on that street spf
VJ says to  (18:52:18):
St Mary's Cathedral perhaps the biggest
judith says to  (18:52:42):
and I don't think Grace Cathedral was completed then
judith says to  (18:52:52):
that's on Geary I believe
609 says to  (18:52:56):
can i ask a dumb question
judith says to  (18:53:03):
just as it becomes O'Farrell
judith says to  (18:53:14):
of course 609, I ask them all the time
VJ says to  (18:53:37):
Yep you are right.
609 says to  (18:54:07):
did they investigate alcatraz prisons who werent in prison that time
judith says to  (18:54:23):
the prison was closed by then I believe... yess it was
judith says to  (18:54:40):
as the takeover had occurred by then
judith says to  (18:55:09):
wait?... maybe
judith says to  (18:55:16):
but no prisoners iirc
609 says to  (18:55:17):
yes i ment who were in az previosly but maby stayed in sf
judith says to  (18:55:43):
I have no idea 609
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:55:43):
speaking of that i read something it might have been on the bates report but i recall seeing the statement they said the boot could be either military or prison issued
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:55:47):
thought that was interesting
VJ says to  (18:56:06):
Like a prison guard?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (18:57:00):
I kinda thought it ment issues to prisoners but I could be wrong
609 says to  (18:57:00):
mann, george floyd az812 941
judith says to  (18:57:16):
?
609 says to  (18:57:34):
my dumb idea :)
judith says to  (18:57:45):
what do you mean?
VJ says to  (18:58:19):
He was a prisoner at Alcatraz
609 says to  (18:58:43):
yes
judith says to  (18:58:44):
VJ, do you recall the name of beautiful church right at corner of Franklin where O'Farrell begins?
judith says to  (18:58:44):
ty
judith says to  (18:59:18):
I suppose Paul's funeral notice with church info is recorded somewhere
VJ says to  (18:59:32):
First Church of Christ?
judith says to  (18:59:56):
that doesn't sound familar to me
VJ says to  (19:00:14):
Uh hold on
judith says to  (19:00:19):
I'll check next time in SF
