SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:01:09):
kinda freaky really
tracers says to  (20:01:17):
where were you when you got the evps?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:01:21):
here
tracers says to  (20:01:37):
odd
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:01:44):
imo spirits can be bi locational
tracers says to  (20:01:56):
yes  i guess so
tracers says to  (20:02:21):
bbiam
judith says to  (20:02:29):
kk
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:02:38):
I really think its a form of "thought " like i.e. you think or pray about your loved ones they feel that and can respond etc. i know its controversial but i am really starting to think thats how it is .
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:04:09):
I just have a hard time trying to get that shit on to audacity so i  can upload files. its pretty creepy but like I said very controversial.
Dr Nash says to  (20:06:41):
i just do not want to see it be made out to be like long island medium that stupid show on tlc
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:06:56):
i used to be a total skeptic of EVP but like this one gal who has now went on to have a very productive and famous biz in the paranormal field "if you dont belive it just buy a plain old tape recorder and record "
tracers says to  (20:07:45):
i do think some evps are real
judith says to  (20:07:51):
so do I
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:07:59):
and sure enough i did just that and the rest was history about 1 hour of trying to make some sort of contact blamo! so strange and no one else was around there was voices that just could not have been there imo.
judith says to  (20:08:44):
hmm spf  I wonder... would they come in in another language?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:08:48):
yeah some are probably faked but shit the ones i have heard with my own ears and others have as well ..just hard to say its not something .
tracers says to  (20:09:13):
agreed
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:09:14):
I have heard "german" and "spanish" and "russian" and some other stuff that just does not make sense
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:09:30):
like it almost sounded like how they "speak in toungues"
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:09:39):
and it does not have to be at night and in a cemetary
judith says to  (20:09:41):
I mean if you were here in old pioneer territory I wonder if that would come through
judith says to  (20:09:43):
kk ty
tracers says to  (20:09:44):
does the sifi channel still have that ghost hunting show with the roto rooter guys?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:09:50):

SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:10:06):
yeah I believe so.
judith says to  (20:10:08):
I like them trace
tracers says to  (20:10:51):
me too!  wish that one guy hadn't left the show--something about family needed to come first
tracers says to  (20:11:07):

tracers says to  (20:11:08):
sad
SerialProfilingFan says to  (20:11:08):

judith says to  (20:21:31):

caseyanthony says to  (21:58:54):
({)
SerialProfilingFan says to  (21:58:55):
I think someone probably was messing with her and has been perhaps she is pretty outspoken about the zodiac stuff lots of ppl have been in here and in the website who knows.
SerialProfilingFan says to  (21:59:12):
one thing is true she has done alot of leg work in this case as well as other cases
SerialProfilingFan says to  (21:59:14):
she gets out there
SerialProfilingFan says to  (21:59:22):
and does her thing .
caseyanthony says to  (21:59:41):
ya she seems like shes telling the truth thats why i ask
SerialProfilingFan says to  (21:59:52):
I think so too.
caseyanthony says to  (21:59:57):
but i definitely think the mind tends to exaggerate things
SerialProfilingFan says to  (21:59:59):
its what she believes
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:00:09):
I do not think she is a "liar" as some have stated.
caseyanthony says to  (22:00:10):
but speaking of tarrance
caseyanthony says to  (22:00:33):
if hes not zodiac  than what was he admitting to on that audio tape
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:00:39):
personally I Like her a bunch shes been nothing but so kool to me .
Dr Nash says to  (22:00:41):
jack has a better chance at being santa claus  then being z.
caseyanthony says to  (22:01:08):
he says something like i havent slit anybodys throat lately
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:01:24):
I think it is just to the point of "ok my stepson thinks im this killer and im sick of dealing with it so i will just play along to shut his ass up?"
tracers says to  (22:01:30):
he could be jerking dennis around
tracers says to  (22:01:39):
dennis could have edited the tape  who knows
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:01:40):
some ppl like to fuck around like that they have dark humor.
caseyanthony says to  (22:01:43):
that would be quite funny
*** (22:01:48):CDillon quit the room
caseyanthony says to  (22:01:59):

SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:08:50):
or is that moot
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:08:56):
wtf? anyway he was cleared
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:09:16):
now if u want to entertain a Team Z scenario then u could argue against the results.
Dr Nash says to  (22:09:32):
wait  aminute that name sounds familar. didn't he and allen write letter to one another
caseyanthony says to  (22:09:33):
i dont think he was cleared
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:09:34):
with that partial DNA dealy
caseyanthony says to  (22:09:51):
dna from stamps which he admitted he doesnt lick cuz they make him sick????
caseyanthony says to  (22:10:04):
that DNA?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:10:30):
http://www.sfgate.com/crime/article/DNA-seems-to-clear-only-Zodiac-suspect-2784268.php
tracers says to  (22:10:45):
yes harold and ala were high school friends annd ALA wrote him in Atescadero
tracers says to  (22:10:52):
i just looked it up
Dr Nash says to  (22:10:58):
allan. had no match via dna or handwritting
caseyanthony says to  (22:11:00):
like i said ; dna from stamps which he wouldnt lick anywyas
tracers says to  (22:11:04):
http://www.zodiackiller.com/1949Class.html
Dr Nash says to  (22:11:06):
interesting things/ but his 'friend
tracers says to  (22:11:13):
http://www.zodiackiller.com/AtascaderoLetter1.html
caseyanthony says to  (22:11:16):
handwriting from his left hand but he was ambidextrous
Dr Nash says to  (22:11:22):
' chenny tends to telll too many tall tales
caseyanthony says to  (22:11:41):
cheney is an exaggerator agreed
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:11:54):
well did they not also test the envelope or corner of a letter as well? with the palm print ? and a part of a index finger or something like that .
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:12:27):
yeah I have heard that he lied some reseracher confronted him about it but who knows .
caseyanthony says to  (22:12:32):
they dont kno for sure who that was from
Dr Nash says to  (22:12:42):
a month or so ago i saw the this the zodiac speaking when they talked about allen. i think bawart said i want to belive chenny. he was going to do a polygraph but he got drunk night before and couldn't do it the next day.
caseyanthony says to  (22:13:03):
law enforcement disagree on wheter ala was actually cleared through dna or fingerprints
caseyanthony says to  (22:13:38):
yes the polygraph was inconclusive because he was under the influence
Dr Nash says to  (22:14:07):
no match. allen had interesting thing about the man. plus chenny lying about allen. then graysmith's book came out, greysmith said allen was z and made bogus claims to help support his theory.
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:14:42):
yeah I will bet to wager my whole supply of rockstar energy drinks and say HE aint the Z
tracers says to  (22:14:58):
lol
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:15:07):
nor are any other the other poi`s
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:15:16):
I still say Z was UNSUB
caseyanthony says to  (22:15:19):
the best evidence that he isnt Z is the eyewitness descriptions
caseyanthony says to  (22:15:33):
not the sketchy dna,fingerpritn evidence
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:15:37):
hell he coulda been interviewed too look at ridgway and others
tracers says to  (22:17:41):
yep
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:18:12):
I hate that its eventually gonna be ..shit or it is ..like JTR
Dr Nash says to  (22:18:20):
gyke is my favourite. i liked ted not as z suspect. rather because of the code. it was only a couple years ago they cracked ted's manephisto they found in his cabin. it told what he did that day what his future aims was. it was really solid code work by simple use of mathematics.  i do not think  ted is z. i just find both of their code work interesting
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:18:24):
a mystery legend etc myth almost
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:18:42):
it is interesting
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:19:08):
Btk was another one it almost seems as if he emulated z and took it a step further in a way.
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:19:22):
he writes like I think zodiac would write hahahah
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:19:35):
misspellings etc military jargon
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:19:44):
LE jargon whatnot.
Dr Nash says to  (22:19:45):
i posted something a few weeks back. on the forum. it's in the crime section
caseyanthony says to  (22:19:54):
dr nash gaikowski was cleared by DNA
caseyanthony says to  (22:20:02):
and handwriting
caseyanthony says to  (22:20:11):
how can u say that for allen but not for gyke
Dr Nash says to  (22:20:17):
they can take dna from gum, cig bud and recreate a person's face from the dna. so far the tests have proved well. it just needs to improve
Dr Nash says to  (22:20:43):
have you seen gyke
Dr Nash says to  (22:20:51):
's handwritting?
woodenigloo says to  (22:20:59):
not true casey, gyke has not been cleared
Dr Nash says to  (22:21:43):
it was almost dead one z writing. captain narlow wanted more samples of gyke's handwriting.
tracers says to  (22:22:05):
how was Gyke cleared via dna?
tracers says to  (22:22:10):
i never heard that
woodenigloo says to  (22:22:28):
caseyanthony is mixed up tracers
Hilding says to  (22:22:33):
Is it possible that the police will be able to get a proper DNA sample from the zodiac? What do you guys think?
*** (22:22:46):Welcome to ZODIACKILLER.COM CHAT , he!
tracers says to  (22:22:48):
i think no
tracers says to  (22:22:56):
too much time and contamination
tracers says to  (22:23:10):
hi he
caseyanthony says to  (22:23:10):
oh right i forgot the police dont want to solve the case
Dr Nash says to  (22:23:14):
they got partal dna of gyke from a letter he sent to loomis.  he looks like the z wanted poster sketch. he is a kown liar. he released a message that got traced back to him that a gov had died.
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:23:22):
howdy HE
caseyanthony says to  (22:23:27):

\thats why they never compared the sample that was sent to them
tracers says to  (22:23:48):
they found female and male dna on the loomis letters i thought
*** (22:23:52):Welcome to ZODIACKILLER.COM CHAT , Guest!
tracers says to  (22:24:12):
did they rule loomis out as the source of the make dna?
Dr Nash says to  (22:24:13):
it wasn't the case. rather sfpd didn't have the budget at the time to use their resources on a cold case. where as nappa county had the money to keep investgating
tracers says to  (22:24:16):
i doubt it
tracers says to  (22:24:28):
napa got money from a cold case grant
caseyanthony says to  (22:24:42):
no tracers they found one that they said was gykes
Hilding says to  (22:24:48):
Has anyone secured a proper DNA sample from the suspect Gaikovski (just in case)?
tracers says to  (22:24:51):
sfpd is way behind dna testing on current cases
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:24:55):
according to a few of the inspt. and det. on the case now a major issue is time and man hours and money at least thats how it seems to m e.
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:25:09):
they dont have the funds.
tracers says to  (22:25:13):
so i don't see them bothering to zodiac dna testing unless they get some really good new leads
he says to  (22:25:16):
hi all
Dr Nash says to  (22:25:24):
i am not sure if they ruled out loomis. i think personally loomis is hiding something about his friend gyke.
tracers says to  (22:25:28):
they tested those glasses little debbie perez had and got nothing
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:25:30):
someone like bill gates or trump has to toss tons of money into the state n agencies
caseyanthony says to  (22:25:42):
i think PURPLE BLAINE is just as good a suspect as gyke
tracers says to  (22:25:49):
i don't think they are going to do any more testing w/out very good reason
tracers says to  (22:26:00):
not just someone saying they have zodiac dna
woodenigloo says to  (22:26:03):
you're nuts
Dr Nash says to  (22:26:23):
cassey the floor is your to make the argugment why blaine is z?
tracers says to  (22:26:53):
casey said as good a suspect as gyke
tracers says to  (22:27:03):
not that blaine is z
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:27:09):
Blainziak
Dr Nash says to  (22:27:47):
oh. let me rephrase that,. what make blaine as a good supsect as dick?
caseyanthony says to  (22:28:20):
tell me the reasons why gyke is a good suspect
Hilding says to  (22:28:26):
What besides the letters/bits of rope could possibly containt DNA? Did find something else on any of the crime scenes?
woodenigloo says to  (22:28:39):
/me back to napping
*** (22:28:48):he quit the room
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:29:18):
I have always thought they have more than they have let out  LE that is .
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:29:23):
to weed out individuals.
tracers says to  (22:29:39):
the police took a green bottle from the lake b scene iirc
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:29:41):
who is to say they do not have more things .
tracers says to  (22:29:45):
and who knows what else
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:29:48):
yup
tracers says to  (22:30:10):
did they ever test the stine cab gloves?
tracers says to  (22:30:15):
i never heard about that
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:30:42):
it would be interesting to test the inside of those gloves
tracers says to  (22:30:51):
did they collect the bloody finngerprints?
tracers says to  (22:30:54):
i doubt it
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:31:02):
I think that it was probably something that was left in the cab from another fare.
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:31:09):
but who really knows.
Dr Nash says to  (22:31:13):
the handwriting. blaine got gyke's handwiriting and gave it to narlow. it was very good. ken needed more but blaine couldn't find any more.  it is almost indentical to z's. not to mention he looks like the z composit sketch. his name is the cypther.  when z said his name in there.  nancy slover hearing gyke's voice and being shaken by the voice as it sounds like the phone call she recieved all those years ago from z.
tracers says to  (22:31:16):
yes  me too spf  but would be good to know
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:31:35):
and if he was in the front seat and did all that he did I can`t believe there was no bloody footprints from the cab
tracers says to  (22:31:45):
didn't narlow have gyke go outside and have gyke do some printing ?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:32:10):
i will second the voice shaking up nancy .
judith says to  (22:32:21):
casey.. dna from Gaikowski has never been obtained/compared to my knowledge
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:32:38):
she was still kinda creeped out when i was talking to her we talked for a while .
tracers says to  (22:33:07):
they got some dna profiles from the loomis letters but sfpd would not compare them to the partial dna profile from 2002 or so
Dr Nash says to  (22:33:09):
nope they didn't have enough at the time to bring gyke in. they staked him out but it gotten blown.
judith says to  (22:33:49):
right Trace re Bode Lab & SFPD
tracers says to  (22:33:49):
i  am jjust trying to clarify something for myself--didn't narlow get some printing directly from Gaik?
*** (22:33:59):Rehab quit the room
tracers says to  (22:34:08):
bbiam
judith says to  (22:34:11):
someone did
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:34:16):
that really does not help the situation with the LAB ughhhhh
judith says to  (22:34:17):
I might have an image of it
Dr Nash says to  (22:34:23):
http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEW44mqZBRw

judith says to  (22:35:11):
SFPD's lab contamination is headline stuff
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:35:46):

SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:35:57):
handwriting , prints, dna etc.

thnx
judith says to  (22:40:54):
were you P.Stine69?
judith says to  (22:41:24):
that question was for you UK
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (22:41:56):
Yes It is just that I am have studied the murder of Paul Stine more than the others.. I did not mean any disrespect.. Sorry.
tracers says to  (22:42:14):
no prob
judith says to  (22:42:16):
no, understood.. appreciate you changing it
tracers says to  (22:42:19):
thanks
judith says to  (22:42:23):
thanks
judith says to  (22:42:57):
do you have any insights/thoughts re that crime?
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (22:43:47):
Yes I believe that Zodiac shot before the car had stopped due to the position of the car and that Zodiac was in the front to stop the car.
judith says to  (22:46:22):
I've not seen anything to make me think the position of the car was unusual for a passenger dropoff
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (22:48:31):
The front wheels were closer to the kurb than the rear wheels. Also the young witness said that it looked like the driver and the passenger were struggling.. maybe Zodiac was moving Stine to sterr and stop the car. Just a thought.
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (22:48:53):
steer*
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:49:08):
I dont buy that theory have u seen the crime scene in person?
tracers says to  (22:49:15):
yes the car was a bit from the curb too
tracers says to  (22:49:30):
whenever I took a cab  they driver pulled right up to the curb
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:49:43):
man he woulda hit something and also there would have been more blood evidence from z moving him trying to get into position to drive etc
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (22:49:56):
no. I have another theory that makes sense about a possible suspect.
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:49:59):
i think the car was parked at a full stop but thats justme.
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:50:19):
who knows anything is possible
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:51:12):
I know Ed had proposed that the car was moving as well he had worked out this theory to his satisfaction but I still did not buy it still dont .but wtf do i know .
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:51:41):
one thing is fo sho!
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:51:47):
WE ARE ACTUALLY TALKING ZODIAC
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:51:50):
omg!
Dr Nash says to  (22:52:01):
possible suspect uk z. i am listening
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (22:52:53):
The poem scratched into the desk was signed ' R H '.. R and H are the first and last letters of the name Robert Graysmith... he was always in the editors office when the letters arrived.. the Zodiac letters contained drawings... Jack the Ripper started his letters ' Dear Boss '.. the 'Editor ' was Graysmiths ' Boss '...
tracers says to  (22:53:03):
bbiam need to make some dinner decisions
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:53:26):
kk trace.
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:53:44):
Dear Editor news flash u wont get the news just yet but Graysmith is the Zodiac
judith says to  (22:54:06):
Rush to the Editor... Gaikowski was an editor too
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:54:39):
I thought it was funny when interviewing bob tarbox he was like "hmmm I wonder why they have not looked into me being a POI"
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:54:54):
i felt like saying "bob your a vampire admit it no one could eat that many oysters"
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:54:57):
he was kool
SerialProfilingFan says to  (22:55:00):
i like that kat man
judith says to  (22:55:01):
how do you know "he was always in the editor's office when the letters arrived" ?
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (22:55:49):
What about when Zodiac said ' I am now in control of all things '.... that was at the same time Graysmith a started a friendship with Toshci.
Dr Nash says to  (22:56:00):
rush to editor and gyke was an editor as well. never though about it that way. interesting
judith says to  (22:56:26):
UK.. what about the editor's office?
Dr Nash says to  (22:57:06):
the debated letter. z sent after being quiet after all those years. calling toshi a pig and not leave him alone. just paraphrasing. that the letter you referring to uk z?
*** (22:57:29):caseyanthony quit the room
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:00:17):
There was Zodiac letters sent to other Editors than the Chronicle... but at the Chronicle was where Graysmith worked. I don't know for sure if he was always in the office when letters arrived but from books it seemed he was always around
tracers says to  (23:00:51):
Uk sounds like you are basing some of your conclusions on the 2007 movie
judith says to  (23:01:30):
my thought as well Trace
judith says to  (23:01:48):
was a terrific movie but a little loose with some of the facts imo
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:02:39):
If Graysmith was involved with the movie he put some clues in to laugh at that only he would know... like his son at the beginning saying he swallowed toothpaste because it ' was minty '... Graysmith replied ' thats not good for you '... in a Zodiac letter he said he wanted to kill people with Peppermint breath.
judith says to  (23:04:11):
Graysmith was more than involved... it was based on his book/theory
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:04:19):
interesting take on that .
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:05:04):
maybe he had to phomit too
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:05:07):
tee-hee
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:05:30):
lol Or wouldn't stop shaking his hand.
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:05:43):
lol
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:05:46):
flabby hands!
Dr Nash says to  (23:05:47):
only reason graysmith was apart of it was his books. he defamed folke in the book. saying to toshi we could been killed at the time stine was killed
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:05:48):
hmmmmmm
Dr Nash says to  (23:06:11):
had finicher not going with greysmith i think it may of had more accuracy
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:08:24):
Garysmith said in an interview that ' the one who did it would probably try and help the detectives '.... that is what he was doing.
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:10:06):
In my mind Graysmith makes a much better suspect than Arthur Leigh Allen.
Dr Nash says to  (23:11:00):
that could be dabted. i remember maybe a few cases i remember reading about in last 12 years. they were cold cases they were from cold case files on a&e.  the killer did try to help police. what i find it comes down is ego. do they want to play both sides? does he was to vast in what he has done.  there is a lot cane be said
*** (23:11:48):Welcome to ZODIACKILLER.COM CHAT , Lee!
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:12:22):
i bet he was at the RElay too
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:12:25):
and other cop bars
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:12:35):
tried to get as close to the investigation .
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:12:43):
i still say he had a police radio scanner too
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:13:15):
some ppl debated that there was none but i have been satisfied to see that there was indeed the technology at that time .
tracers says to  (23:14:15):
graysmith seemed to start researching the case in 1978 or so
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:14:32):
Also Zodiac was said to have Dark Brown hair ( almost Black ) that came over his eyebows almost into his eyes... I think Sheppard said that before she died.. saying his hair came through the eye-holes of his executioners hood... Graysmith had that colour and that length hair.
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:14:37):
At that time
tracers says to  (23:14:53):
if he was zodiac and wanted to insinuate himself into the investigation and "ehlp" police, why did RH wait 9 years to do so?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:15:13):
cause "9" is a z thang!
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:15:37):
was it not 9 months from the first known murders to the next communication n murder!!!
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:15:39):

UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:20:11):
Wasn't Graysmith an Eagle Scout ??? Faraday the first victim was also an Eagle Scout if I am not mistaken !!!!

UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:22:15):
Why did Robert Gray Smith change his name to Robert Graysmith ?
SerialProfilingFan says to  (23:22:31):
cheer up boss!
tracers says to  (23:23:00):
maybe he felt smith was too common a last name and he w3anted  to stand out more as a cartoonist?
tracers says to  (23:23:46):
i have a friend who hated her last name
tracers says to  (23:24:18):
after she divorced she kept her ex's last name cuz she didn't like her own
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:24:23):
Also what about this... the line ' blue meanies ' was used in a Zodiac letter... it was first used in the Beatles Movie Yellow Submarine the first full lenght animation...
Dr Nash says to  (23:25:23):

UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:39:32):
That is the one... what do you think of him ?
tracers says to  (23:39:40):
not much
tracers says to  (23:39:54):
he can't even be placed in CA during z times
tracers says to  (23:40:30):
if brooks' book ever comes out we  shall see if he has anything beyond conjecture
judith says to  (23:40:43):
and was only released from prison hours prior iirc
judith says to  (23:40:57):
in a snowstorm, difficult to even have gotten to CA in time
tracers says to  (23:41:08):
i think he got out on the 18th of dec
tracers says to  (23:41:11):
not sure tho
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:41:12):
All I know is he was supposed to have a slow speech.. like ' Goood Byyyeee '  and he supposedly told his cell mates he was going to collect slaves for his after life
judith says to  (23:41:19):
me either trace
tracers says to  (23:41:34):
yeah ed edwards claimed in his book there was such a man
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:41:47):
Yes thats right.
tracers says to  (23:42:09):
based on the crime--killing of dep sheriff, a friend and I figured out edwards was alluding to bujok
Dr Nash says to  (23:42:10):
brooks. first or last anme?
tracers says to  (23:42:21):
but who knows what you can believe from a killer
tracers says to  (23:42:26):
Kevin Brooks
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:42:53):
I would definately read his book
tracers says to  (23:43:05):
obviously more people than zodiac had ideas about collecting slaves
tracers says to  (23:43:20):
well we shall see if it ever comes out
tracers says to  (23:43:32):
some books never materialize
tracers says to  (23:43:42):
i would read it too
tracers says to  (23:43:45):
and see
tracers says to  (23:43:59):
but he better not charge 48 bucks like Lafferty did
judith says to  (23:44:07):
trace even read Lafferty's book, she is very generous with her time
tracers says to  (23:44:13):
lafferty's book was poorly researched and had NO proof
tracers says to  (23:44:27):
and I spent 48 bucks for a ppiece of crap
judith says to  (23:44:43):
at least it didn't fall apart on you trace, lol
tracers says to  (23:44:47):
has turned me off buying new zodiac books
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:44:48):
I wonder if there are clues in the way the Zodiac said he would torture his slaves.. like hanging them in sun and feeding them salt water.. rubbing deep heat into them.. that sounds Japanese like the Mikalo.
tracers says to  (23:44:49):
LOL
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:45:08):
LOL... I seen some of that book online
tracers says to  (23:45:13):

Dr Nash says to  (23:45:41):
hmm. not sure. i finished reading sudden terror about ons.  sidenote i found ray grant on youtube doing blogs about z
UK-Zodiac-Scholar says to  (23:45:46):
Yeah.. he enjoyed the media attention more than killing I think

Dr Nash says to  (23:54:16):
i think bitterfield hurt himself and no one is going to touch him after he bashed everyone. didn't bitter's site get shut down or something
tracers says to  (23:54:20):

judith says to  (00:21:10):
I'm going to have to rely on le opinions that it was Z

Dr Nash says to  (00:22:07):
i think it was z as well. it was also dome similair to lake b.

A lot of people are waiting for 7-ish
Bargle says to  (01:01:24):
Itr's 9 here in the East.
a9e8qd says to  (01:01:25):

TANEYTOWN says to  (01:01:32):
Whats the topic tonight?
butterfield says to  (01:01:40):
my new book
Bargle says to  (01:01:44):
Lake Berryessa.
a9e8qd says to  (01:01:44):
haha
Shawn says to  (01:01:47):
lol
Shawn says to  (01:01:58):
butter is killing me
Rehab says to  (01:02:05):
it's the 44th anniversary of the Zodiac's attack at Lake Berryessa, but feel free to chat about anything
TANEYTOWN says to  (01:02:14):
Butterfield what's the topic of your new book?
Dr Nash says to  (01:02:43):
sidenote tom how are you doing after that dental operation or somethiong of that nature?
Shawn says to  (01:03:21):
I hate tooth problems or anything related
TANEYTOWN says to  (01:03:24):
I've never understood why Z went so dfiffernt on that attack. Seems so bizare
Starless says to  (01:04:06):
And unlike the two lover's lanes murders he stabbed them
a9e8qd says to  (01:04:16):
the Lake B attack is then one that really stuck with me when I was a kid.
Shawn says to  (01:04:38):
that would be a scary thing to a child
a9e8qd says to  (01:04:44):
i saw a special on Z, when i was pretty young. the LB attack kinda haunted my thoughts
Starless says to  (01:04:47):
ery hands on, but he still was hesitant to approach them until the man was tied up
TANEYTOWN says to  (01:05:03):
So z puts on a costume and knifes them.Really strange.
a9e8qd says to  (01:05:13):
it was, shawn. but at the same time, it  "sparked" the fire i suppose
Starless says to  (01:05:34):
And then leaves a message on the car door
butterfield says to  (01:05:47):
2 parts: i prove in my book that tom is the zodiac killer and should be in jail for the rest of his life
Shawn says to  (01:05:58):
lol
Starless says to  (01:06:10):
Tom isn't old enough to be Z
Dr Nash says to  (01:06:17):
i think he went that far for fear and press. the costume he was wearing would make for frightening news. more fear
butterfield says to  (01:06:29):
he used a time machine
Shawn says to  (01:06:42):
if they would have both died....then nobody would have known about the outfit
a9e8qd says to  (01:06:49):
that and no one ever reported The Shins being played in any of the suspects vehicles
Starless says to  (01:07:13):
I don't know if he killed Cheri jo, but the Faraday/jensen murders got hardly any news coverage
TANEYTOWN says to  (01:07:23):
Anybody ever think Z was simply performing a sociology experiment? Just so randome and strange.
Starless says to  (01:07:46):
the July 4th attack either, but then after he sent that three part letter, BAM
Starless says to  (01:07:55):
he was definitely seeking attention
Dr Nash says to  (01:08:31):
another thing to tae account for lake b is the santa barbra attack. it was done in a similar fashion years prior to that
TANEYTOWN says to  (01:08:53):
This didn't seem like the normal sexual anger of many killers. Seemed like he was randomly varrying his metthods to see the reaction he would get.
TANEYTOWN says to  (01:09:34):
He boasted about lots of things he never did. Again wanting to see the reaction?
Starless says to  (01:09:38):
I think he was envious of the people he killed because they had normal lives, something I think he did not have
Bargle says to  (01:10:08):

Hmmm, maybe he was hoping to strike terror into the couple and it flopped? C & B had no idea who he was.
Starless says to  (01:10:12):
He challenged police and pressmen in his letters

hahaha
judith says to  (01:39:36):
this is getting borderline old butterfield
TANEYTOWN says to  (01:40:02):
The real Busterfield wouldn't have the guts to walk in here.
ekas1 says to  (01:40:12):
It's Tom himself, trolling.
tracers says to  (01:40:18):
no he has to ask to sleep on our sofas during his nationwide book tour
Bargle says to  (01:40:21):
Speaking of books, there's an e-book out now on the Valerie Percy murder. It's by Glenn Wall and called "Sympathy Vote". Available at Amazon and Barnes and Noble. I helped some with research on the book.
andrew8958 says to  (01:40:48):
cool
tracers says to  (01:40:59):
coo bargle
tracers says to  (01:41:06):
will it ever be a paper book?
tracers says to  (01:41:12):
i hate ebooks
andrew8958 says to  (01:41:36):
I just finished a book on that HH Holmes

Bargle says to  (01:42:25):
Hopefully there will be a paper edition. I don't have an e-reader myself.
tracers says to  (01:42:34):
is that hh holmes that doc who murdered at the world fair period
andrew8958 says to  (01:42:55):
yep. I just finished reading Devil in the White City
tracers says to  (01:43:03):
i have that book it was good
Bargle says to  (01:43:12):
We still don't know who killed her. Glenn does bring a couple of new suspects, but there'snothing definite.
TANEYTOWN says to  (01:43:15):
Anybody into the Monster of Florance?
andrew8958 says to  (01:43:30):
yeah, it was something else, that hotel he built and everything. I think Decaprio is going to play him in the film version.
tracers says to  (01:44:07):
yes all the weird passages etc
andrew8958 says to  (01:44:11):
right
*** (01:44:12):Welcome to ZODIACKILLER.COM CHAT , Momurda!
Shawn says to  (01:44:16):
Andrew...was it a good book?
tracers says to  (01:44:17):
some ghost show went there
andrew8958 says to  (01:44:18):
the gas jets in the room and the vault
tracers says to  (01:44:24):
yes
andrew8958 says to  (01:44:28):
it was excellent, gripping
tracers says to  (01:44:38):
there is another book out about him called depraved
Bargle says to  (01:44:40):
Yes, it's a good read.
tracers says to  (01:44:43):
or something like that
andrew8958 says to  (01:44:44):
and you also got the story of  how that expo was built.
tracers says to  (01:44:49):
yes
Bargle says to  (01:45:13):
Depraved is by H. Schecter (sp?)
tracers says to  (01:45:21):
not sur
Bargle says to  (01:45:25):

I've got that one as well.
Shawn says to  (01:45:27):
Wasn't the guy selling body parts?
tracers says to  (01:45:29):
read it about 6 years ago
andrew8958 says to  (01:45:32):
right
tracers says to  (01:45:46):
yes to get rid of the bodies
Shawn says to  (01:45:53):
Ben Franklin would buy body parts in Paris
tracers says to  (01:45:57):
i think part of the hotel is a post office now
andrew8958 says to  (01:46:04):
interesting
tracers says to  (01:46:10):
why did ben want body aprts?
Bargle says to  (01:46:17):
That's another one where we'll never know for sure just how many he killed.
Shawn says to  (01:46:22):
Franklin was interested in anatomy
andrew8958 says to  (01:46:35):
right, they said anywhere from 7 to 200 victims
Shawn says to  (01:46:38):
what better way to find out then cut open bodies

Thanks, Tracers.

nothig about DNA, but am optimistic about the DMV letter

Sorry, I went outside. Ambulance. Hope my neighbors are fine.
ekas1 says to  (01:52:30):
Sure, tracers.
TANEYTOWN says to  (01:52:33):
Had really highhopes on DNA
tracers says to  (01:52:34):
oh no hope so ekas
tracers says to  (01:52:51):
well i think the sfpd dna partial      sample is useless
stevehodel says to  (01:52:57):
Yes, it really all comes down to that
Starless says to  (01:53:03):
why?
Starless says to  (01:53:13):
why useless?
Bullit says to  (01:53:15):
yea itsva nice one of Lake B too the water level is down 4sure
stevehodel says to  (01:53:41):
sfpd sample in not confirmed and could have come from anyone  reporter/detective/
tracers says to  (01:53:46):
the sfpd dna guy from the 80's  and 90's told various people that there were not enough cells to get a good profile
tracers says to  (01:54:02):
also the letetrs had been passed around many times stored in cops garages etc
tracers says to  (01:54:15):
i don't see how the partial can be reliable
Shawn says to  (01:54:15):
what about Palm prints from the letters?
Bargle says to  (01:54:26):
And everything handled bare handed.
tracers says to  (01:54:31):
yep
judith says to  (01:54:34):
added to the sfpd lab is reported to be in a state of chaos
stevehodel says to  (01:55:06):
all of the physical evidence is really inclusive  if its a hit/match then ok  if its negative doesn't really tell us anything
tracers says to  (01:55:18):
ekas can you post the url link to that lake b pic
tracers says to  (01:55:33):
right mr hodel
tracers says to  (01:55:45):
bbiam
Starless says to  (01:55:58):
Is there any dna sample or print that is absolutely Zodiac in this whole thing?
Shawn says to  (01:55:59):
Graysmith was able to get them moving on the DNA front
Shawn says to  (01:56:09):
with ALA
andrew8958 says to  (01:56:27):
who has the Albany med. center letter and envelope?
stevehodel says to  (01:56:32):
on all of my old crime scene investigations we ALWAYS had unidentified prints could be a maid, a bf, a mover, anything so only valuable if they are a make
a9e8qd says to  (01:56:40):
*making dinner and return to my laptop to see Graysmith
a9e8qd says to  (01:56:44):
*no longer hungry
*** (01:57:35):andrew8958 quit the room
stevehodel says to  (01:57:49):
even ALA cannot be eliminated based on the three loci because they dont know the three are zodiac's
Starless says to  (01:58:21):
I mean, surely with all of those letters, and if dna was obtained from the seals or stamps, they were able to compare them to eachother, increasing probability of a good sample

right
stevehodel says to  (01:58:42):
i agree but so far NADA
Starless says to  (01:59:02):
Nada what steve?
stevehodel says to  (01:59:12):
I have pushed DOJ to test the Stine gloves but last word was "they can't find them."
tracers says to  (01:59:20):
thanks ekas
Starless says to  (01:59:27):
well that's not good
stevehodel says to  (01:59:34):
nada DNA   They have no confirmed zodiac dna
judith says to  (01:59:46):
and not surprising re the gloves
Starless says to  (02:00:24):
but I'm saying if they got dna from various letters, and it all matched, chances are...
Shawn says to  (02:00:28):
I guess the Z case became a very unimportant case to the SFPD at one time
Starless says to  (02:00:37):
The guy definitely wrote the letters
tracers says to  (02:01:47):
they did try to get dna from the available letters in 2002  and did get a partial profile, but most of the letters had no usable samples
Starless says to  (02:01:59):
oh, that's too bad
tracers says to  (02:02:22):
and since the letters and envelopes had been handled many timmes over the years hard to know  whose dna the partial is

ekas1 says to  (02:02:46):
Before I leave tonight, I'd like to be selfish and share something. It's something Paul Stine and I will have in common starting monday. It will feel weird.
*** (02:02:54):a9e8qd quit the room
stevehodel says to  (02:03:00):
again, that 2002 partial profile is not valid by itself. all they have is dna off the envelope no guarantee its zodiac's. the media just ran with it for "showbiz" and excluded ALA but not the police
tracers says to  (02:03:11):
could be with new advances more could be done in the future if there is any dna left
tracers says to  (02:03:27):
but i don't see sfpd even trying unless there is some super compelling reason\
andrew2139 says to  (02:03:41):
what, ekas?
stevehodel says to  (02:03:41):
yes, i hope so, that's what im waiting for only chance of clearing the case is through dna
Shawn says to  (02:03:43):
Steve....thanks....I thought ALA was excluded
tracers says to  (02:03:46):
what ekas?
tracers says to  (02:03:59):
are you going to grad school?
tracers says to  (02:04:04):
get married?
Starless says to  (02:04:09):
well if that's the case, then there really never can be a "for sure" sample
tracers says to  (02:04:17):
ALA was excluded based on that partial profile
Starless says to  (02:04:22):
someone's gonna steal his glasses
ekas1 says to  (02:04:24):
Well weird is not the word. I will start work in the same place he did.
stevehodel says to  (02:04:27):
eveyone "thinks" he was but in reality you can't clear him without confirmed zodiac dna
tracers says to  (02:04:28):
but imo that profile is not proof either way
Bargle says to  (02:04:29):
Start driving a cab?

darlene ewas a waitress and mike did who knows what

no he didn't but he had a cult following and kind of passed himself off as a "prince of darkness"

What did Mike do?

lolol steve ok I see

but I don't think he picked his victims  based on anything to do with their lives
killingvector says to  (02:14:43):
He may have marked Mike and Dee, it is certainly possible.
tracers says to  (02:14:48):
so hard to know  what is or isn't true  about the darlene stalker stories
Bargle says to  (02:14:49):
troller IMO, Mike and Darlene were victims by chance.
Starless says to  (02:14:54):
I didn't exactly mean his victims, I think to him his real "victims" were the police
stevehodel says to  (02:15:04):
they were victims in the right place at the wrong time and when they were not in the right place he directed them there. (stine)
tracers says to  (02:15:06):
ahh I see starless
Starless says to  (02:15:11):
he mouthed constantly about how much smarter he was
tracers says to  (02:15:15):
yes
killingvector says to  (02:15:33):
Berryessa certainly was a random crime, as was Lake Herman Rd.
ekas1 says to  (02:15:34):
A smart coward.
tracers says to  (02:15:45):
bbiam
Starless says to  (02:16:02):
I think he wanted to be a person of authority, police or military, but was rejected because obviously he was not right in the head
Bullit says to  (02:16:19):
a smart and lonely coward
andrew2139 says to  (02:16:22):
I have a theory about Lake B being a retaliation killing.
killingvector says to  (02:16:24):
But he was actually 'caught' by two SFPD......unfortunately, they dropped the ball.
judith says to  (02:16:42):
go for it drew
a9e8qd says to  (02:16:54):
ekas1: why "coward"? im not asking to be an ass or anything, i just am honestly curious in your word choice is all
killingvector says to  (02:16:54):
Anyone here know much about Riverside?
*** (02:17:02):ebecker quit the room
ekas1 says to  (02:17:20):
He's a coward because he attacked young and defenseless youngsters.
andrew2139 says to  (02:17:57):
there was a fatal shooting of an African American man by a police officer almost exactly one year prior to Lake B.
a9e8qd says to  (02:18:00):
would that make gacy a coward as well?
Starless says to  (02:18:00):
maybe the police departments should look back through old applications at who was rejected in the few years before this, but argh, they probably don't keep that old stuff
yarb says to  (02:18:05):
he attacked unarmed, innocent people
andrew2139 says to  (02:18:09):
it was covered extensively in SF Express Times
Starless says to  (02:18:21):
Gacy was just enjoying himself
killingvector says to  (02:18:25):
Tom's site says that there were eyewitnesses who saw two men looking in the alley where Bates was killed looking for something with a flash light. I have not found any mention of this fact anywhere else.
stevehodel says to  (02:18:34):
I am in the corner of those that believe officer Fouke stopped and talked to Zodiac. Just too much evidence to not believe it.
andrew2139 says to  (02:18:48):
I think so too
a9e8qd says to  (02:19:05):
and dont take me the wrong way guys, i have any real reason for asking... i just like pondering and thought coward was an interesting choice
stevehodel says to  (02:19:09):
His partner and partner's widow would not lie
ekas1 says to  (02:19:10):
Yes, yarb
tracers says to  (02:19:12):
me too
andrew2139 says to  (02:19:14):
Seems like he must have given him a quick look over for so detailed a description
killingvector says to  (02:19:16):
They at least slowed, eyeballed him. It was not a clean getaway.
a9e8qd says to  (02:19:23):
dont have any reason...
killingvector says to  (02:19:37):
Which is probably why he never killed again, imo.
ekas1 says to  (02:19:48):
a9e8qd, does the word fit in your opinion?
a9e8qd says to  (02:20:00):
i dunno, i was thinking that myself...
a9e8qd says to  (02:20:02):
haha
stevehodel says to  (02:20:04):
You know in a later interview officer Fouke said in his "35-45" description that Zodiac was more at "the high end"
ekas1 says to  (02:20:13):
Okay, Ha
Shawn says to  (02:20:23):
In his 40's?
andrew2139 says to  (02:20:26):
arent' the first impressions always the best?
killingvector says to  (02:20:38):
It was dark though, Steve. Shadows make people look older.
killingvector says to  (02:20:57):
I think the range has to be considered in play.
stevehodel says to  (02:21:00):
No mid Forties.  George Hodel was late Fifties, but could easily pass for mid Forties in '69
Shawn says to  (02:21:12):
police officers see lots of people at night...seems they could tell age
killingvector says to  (02:21:17):
Steve, are you saying your father was Z?
Shawn says to  (02:21:40):
even in the dark
killingvector says to  (02:21:44):
They do see a lot of people, but they are also people themselves and can make errors.
stevehodel says to  (02:21:52):
I'm saying he could be at DNA will tell the tale. (I wrote a book on it presenting all the evidence.)
killingvector says to  (02:22:23):
The Z DNA is problematic though.
Shawn says to  (02:22:25):
Thanks Steve....I had no idea Z could be in his mid 40's
Bargle says to  (02:22:42):
Wish I could stay longer, But I've got to work tomorrow. G'night all.

Dr Nash says to  (02:24:04):
and back
tracers says to  (02:24:15):
wb
Shawn says to  (02:24:24):
I really never thought of Z being in his 40's...wow
Starless says to  (02:24:45):
you thought he would be younger or older?
tracers says to  (02:24:51):
i don't see how dna will prove anything if all sfpd has is a questionable partial profile  that if valid would only exclude people
Shawn says to  (02:24:58):
20's or 30's
killingvector says to  (02:25:14):
The Z DNA won't solve this case.  I agree tracers.
yarb says to  (02:25:14):
truth, tracers
tracers says to  (02:25:23):
frustrating
Starless says to  (02:25:29):
I've always got the impression from everything I've ever heard that he was middle-aged
stevehodel says to  (02:25:41):
confirmed dna will but they need to test all the evidence from all jurisdictions
andrew2139 says to  (02:25:44):
he used the phrase "those kids"
killingvector says to  (02:25:51):
I always thought it would come down to someone finding discarded, unsent or draft Z letters or clothing worn by Z.
Shawn says to  (02:26:05):
interesting andrew....sounds like an older man
stevehodel says to  (02:26:06):
and wore pleated pants in the 70s.  Old School.
killingvector says to  (02:26:08):
Not with a partial profile, steve. There is no full profile.
Bullit says to  (02:26:26):
yes he did ust that phrase those kids
Shawn says to  (02:26:28):
or a Parent
tracers says to  (02:26:32):
I wonder if Napa and SFPD compared their dna findings
stevehodel says to  (02:26:32):
No, that's what I'm saying. They need to test and get some.
Dr Nash says to  (02:26:34):
well tracer this where is where it will come in handy once the art of doing is perfected http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEW44mqZBRw

Getting Z DNA may be as hard as getting T Rex DNA.
Starless says to  (02:27:24):
Isn't it odd, a middle-aged man doing this?
andrew2139 says to  (02:27:26):
yeah, and he wasn't dismissive at all of Gyke's pic
Dr Nash says to  (02:27:30):
looks like butterfield is off to work on his book some more
*** (02:27:33):Welcome to ZODIACKILLER.COM CHAT , jackthehipster!
stevehodel says to  (02:27:37):
He also slipped up and said his impression was that the suspect had a Scot background.  Don't get that from looks.  He got that from voice.
Starless says to  (02:27:37):
Seems like more something a younger person would do

He said he had a Scottish accent?
tracers says to  (02:28:43):
wow dr nash  that video was interesting  is it reliable?
Bullit says to  (02:28:48):
theres a lot of older bitter men out there even today
stevehodel says to  (02:28:52):
Your right Welsh in his Memo
Dr Nash says to  (02:28:54):
once the science is perfected. with the dna faces of criminals could be recreated.  it could work for z, ons and many others.
jackthehipster says to  (02:28:57):
i think i know the the zodiac killer is
Bullit says to  (02:29:07):
maybe even more today then at that time
andrew2139 says to  (02:29:17):
I wondered if Z may have been trying to fake an Irish or UK sounding accent

There's so much to it

I enjoyed Kelleher's book.
Dr Nash says to  (02:33:08):
it take what 125 years to write

I wasn't sure who Nash was talking about.

a9e8qd says to  (02:34:03):
lol
stevehodel says to  (02:34:05):
In my fu book BDA II I present some addition info related to Zodiac and handwriting.  Also DOJ HW expert analyzed George Hodel's HW to Zodiac and "could not eliminate him". They wanted more lowercase samples, but I have very few. Mostly uppercase.

however

I interviewed John Shimoda a couple years ago and that was news to him, so...
tracers says to  (02:49:32):

]ahhhh
killingvector says to  (02:49:37):
three letters could possibily be traced to a particular mailing location?
killingvector says to  (02:49:57):
or locations.
Rehab says to  (02:49:58):
yes, one on Taraval Street a block rom -- and in view of -- the police station
Rehab says to  (02:50:07):
the other was Lombard and Van Ness
Rehab says to  (02:50:18):
don't remember the third
Shawn says to  (02:50:26):
Are these new letters?
Rehab says to  (02:50:31):
no
killingvector says to  (02:50:32):
Was Kelleher the source for this information?
a9e8qd says to  (02:50:39):
so a letter can be traced to its dropped location?
Shawn says to  (02:50:40):
oh
Rehab says to  (02:50:50):
yes, and he won't name his source, so...
a9e8qd says to  (02:51:03):
like if i drove down the road, and dropped one in a blue box, if need be later one they could trace that?
a9e8qd says to  (02:51:14):
later on
Rehab says to  (02:51:17):
Not back then
a9e8qd says to  (02:51:28):

Rehab says to  (02:51:51):
the postal worker emptied the box and recognized a Zodiac letter
killingvector says to  (02:51:56):
at least you could trace to a particular PO
a9e8qd says to  (02:51:57):
i was gonna ask, how the hell does that work
a9e8qd says to  (02:52:05):
oh, ok ok ok. i see

Shawn says to  (02:54:52):
What was the deal with the card that had the KEYS in it?
Shawn says to  (02:55:03):
xerox of keys
Dr Nash says to  (02:55:20):
i think i remeber ray grant mention something like that with the two men and bates and the alley way

killingvector says to  (02:56:01):
I haven't found the source for that information though, rehab. Could you tell me (generally) where that information came from?
Rehab says to  (02:56:06):
the keys and also the hint about where to find the frozen banana
tracers says to  (02:56:17):
kiingvector, a reliable source said some neighbors had seen the two men
tracers says to  (02:56:39):
oops i was lagging
killingvector says to  (02:56:41):
It wasn't in the police report. But it is reliable?
tracers says to  (02:56:44):
soorry
Rehab says to  (02:56:48):
Bud Kelley is who told me originally
killingvector says to  (02:56:58):
He was certain?
Rehab says to  (02:57:05):
there are maybe five pages available of their reports
tracers says to  (02:57:05):
is he the cop that read her diary and took it home?
Rehab says to  (02:57:14):
yess he is the one

why did Bates "have to die"???
tracers says to  (02:57:58):
well tom did not interview bud til decadeslater
Rehab says to  (02:57:58):
he told me in 1998 or so
Rehab says to  (02:58:14):
the writer never elaborated Starless
killingvector says to  (02:58:14):
Do you believe him?
killingvector says to  (02:58:26):
Or is this a grain of salt deal?
Rehab says to  (02:58:43):
I believe there is such a witness, and I believe RPD has volumes of reports we have never seen
tracers says to  (02:58:45):
why would he lie about any of that?  but i guess it is possible
tracers says to  (02:58:56):
no idea starless
Starless says to  (02:59:03):
me either
tracers says to  (02:59:10):
that set of letters could just be a cruel hoax

hi Colette!
killingvector says to  (03:00:01):
In the West Memphis 3 case, there a number of felons who have come forward with information linking stepparents to the crime. But it is hard to accept information from such people considering their backgrounds.
yarb says to  (03:00:04):
hello
Shawn says to  (03:00:07):
I'm thinking Z didn't kill bates
colette says to  (03:00:08):

What if Bates killed Z then assumed his personality trait?
judith says to  (03:00:46):
hello colette
tracers says to  (03:00:46):
now you sound like catseye
killingvector says to  (03:00:47):
I think if two men were in the alley, that does support RPD theory of the crime. Perhaps two men involved, hence the lack of DNA match.
colette says to  (03:00:51):
who do you think killed bates?
Rehab says to  (03:00:53):
or Baba lol

the desk poem seems like a stretch though, but it is hard to parse Merrill's reports for info that supports your theory.
colette says to  (03:03:35):
ya desk poem,,, red herring
tracers says to  (03:03:51):
i don't see how you can match scratching on a desk top to handwriting/printing
colette says to  (03:04:01):
true
yarb says to  (03:04:04):
true
woodenigloo says to  (03:04:06):
neither can I tracers
tracers says to  (03:04:09):
that desk top wood had ridges
a9e8qd says to  (03:04:16):
why not?
tracers says to  (03:04:20):
at least the desks I had like that did
a9e8qd says to  (03:04:22):
just curious
colette says to  (03:04:36):
because its not fluid like a pen
tracers says to  (03:04:50):
from what I recall that type of desk top wood was layered plywood or such
yarb says to  (03:04:51):
different force, etc
a9e8qd says to  (03:04:54):
when  i think about scratching into anything, i think ur gonna do it two different ways
killingvector says to  (03:04:56):
If you throw out the desk, I think you have to throw out his matching of the letters too b/c it puts his credibilty in quesiton.
tracers says to  (03:04:59):
had ridges/ripples
*** (03:05:13):Welcome to ZODIACKILLER.COM CHAT , Benicia Boy!
a9e8qd says to  (03:05:16):
one way with just straight lines, the other "mimicing" ur actual HW style

hi b boy

hi bb
yarb says to  (03:05:21):

Shawn says to  (03:05:23):
The watch found at the Bates crime scene was from a small wrist person....not what you would think from a a stocky man
tracers says to  (03:05:46):
could it have been her watch?
colette says to  (03:05:50):
someone who was painting... maybe ear/ons

Hi folks
Shawn says to  (03:06:02):
dunno
killingvector says to  (03:06:06):
If rehab's source is on the money, two people went back looking for it.  Could two men have ambushed her?

bob played sports and seemed pretty sturdy to me
colette says to  (03:06:16):
they are tying paint chips to ear/ons

Was the desk letter scratched or was it just written on the desk?

makes me wanna do a test, bbiam
Starless says to  (03:06:30):
I lways thought it was just written
colette says to  (03:06:36):
there was paint specks on watch
tracers says to  (03:06:38):
i think more likely one killed  and brought a friend back later
tracers says to  (03:06:45):
but anything is possible
killingvector says to  (03:07:03):
The DNA under her nails didn't match RPD's suspect.
tracers says to  (03:07:04):
ray grant is convinced one person held her while the other attacked her

What if two men were there?
killingvector says to  (03:07:18):
Was the friend ever tested?
colette says to  (03:07:27):

part written if i remember

You didn't miss much....except he claims Foukes describes Z as possibly being his 40's
tracers says to  (03:20:00):
hodel was talking about fouke and how he must have talked to the guy  if fouke mentiioned welsh as you can't get that from just looking at someone
colette says to  (03:20:02):
was he talking about his book?
Starless says to  (03:20:16):
Well we talked a lot about how everyone has no dna for the Zodiac that is reliable
colette says to  (03:20:20):
oh i see

he also said the case will probably never be solved until///   if positive dna is obtained and matched to a suspect

how all the samples are contaminated

tracers says to  (03:22:50):
in 2002 there was almost nothing to get dna from iirc
a9e8qd says to  (03:22:54):
this is "old news" but still, its interesting
colette says to  (03:22:59):
my son is in st louis

A 3 1/2 year old daughter and a  2 1/2 year old son.
tracers says to  (03:23:05):
the envelopes stamps did not haveenough cells
colette says to  (03:23:10):
ah nice
ebecker says to  (03:23:21):
Hang on, I'm going to stupefy you all with their cuteness.
tracers says to  (03:23:22):
only a few letters had usable dna  and from that all they got was a partial

tracers says to  (03:23:35):
who knows if there is any dna left to test from the letters
tracers says to  (03:23:52):
me too col  but I assume Napa tested it with the cold case grant money
tracers says to  (03:23:59):
but no way to be sure
colette says to  (03:24:06):
my son is a traveling nurse

Starless says to  (03:25:25):
I mean, you can say, yah, maybe other people touched them. but can't they seperate the profiles? And find a common thread? And rule out the people who may have touched them?
ebecker says to  (03:25:28):
Indeed.  Too fast.
colette says to  (03:25:58):
do we ever hear from ed?
colette says to  (03:26:43):
k i guess not
Shawn says to  (03:27:09):
i've heard his name before...seem like he was heavily involved then dropped off a cliff
Starless says to  (03:27:11):
Does anyone think almost getting caught after the Stine murder freaked him out enough for him to stop the killing end of his little adventure at least?
colette says to  (03:27:30):
could be starless

bye yarb

judith says to  (03:28:25):
I think it only ended his little adventure as Z on killing sites
judith says to  (03:28:51):
letters continued and I think murders did too but being "Z" was going to bring too much heat
colette says to  (03:28:55):
well maybe he stopped killing and just wrote
killingvector says to  (03:29:14):
I liked Kelleher's theory that Z was scared off by that encounter and underwent a psychological breakdown in the years that followed, as evident by the changing tone of his later letters.
Starless says to  (03:29:20):
I think he was a chicken
Starless says to  (03:29:29):
he was yeller
judith says to  (03:29:29):
imo he continued both... just stopped taking public credit for killings
Starless says to  (03:29:42):
wouldn't touch anyone
colette says to  (03:29:49):
http://www.scribd.com/doc/74858423/Sudden-Terror
Starless says to  (03:29:52):
practically shot Stine in the back
colette says to  (03:30:04):
there is the link to the free sudden terror
Starless says to  (03:30:08):
but he could shoot
killingvector says to  (03:30:10):
But he took credit for crimes for which he played no part.

Hello
a9e8qd says to  (03:32:25):
i didnt try to  force it, i tried to "carve" naturally
Starless says to  (03:32:32):
I'm starying to tire of the "My parent was the Zodiac" thing that has been happening
colette says to  (03:32:39):
hi mulh
mulhollandvelvet says to  (03:32:51):
Did I miss all the action?
a9e8qd says to  (03:32:52):
its tougher than i thought, and id say its probably difficult to get an anal from a carve
Rehab says to  (03:32:58):
did not miss
colette says to  (03:33:08):
the action is now
a9e8qd says to  (03:33:09):
so id have to say id agree with ur statement earlier
a9e8qd says to  (03:33:24):
hahahaha, difficult to get an anal
Rehab says to  (03:33:24):
I am surprised that hidden "WINCHESTER" inside the gun chamber didn't get more attention

hidden winchester?
killingvector says to  (03:34:15):
I'll wait for the DNA to clear my dad.
Benicia Boy says to  (03:34:25):
I went to the task force meeting in 2007 with my dad, and he was probably the most likely suspect in that theater
Rehab says to  (03:34:25):
Hward Stern interrogated my father about being the Zodiac back in 1998, so I think I started that trend
Starless says to  (03:34:26):
And people coming out and saying they have solved cyphers, but then you never hear anything else
judith says to  (03:34:36):
I was surprised by the Winchester lack of interest as well

Zodiac was only Zodiac for a grand total of 20 months, then he moved on
tracers says to  (03:43:36):
who knows star?  he could have written other letters we never saw or letters that no one picked up on as zodiac
Rehab says to  (03:43:44):
He made huge $$$ for that gig, hardly a fail
Starless says to  (03:43:45):
Or did he get killed?

even just a freak accident and poof
tracers says to  (03:43:59):
true
Starless says to  (03:44:15):
How can someone do something like he did and then just go away?

maybe Z was DB Cooper.
Benicia Boy says to  (03:44:39):
Oooh, I like that Roz
Rehab says to  (03:44:45):
well he did, was only Zodiac for 20 months, then left for a few years and when he returned to writing letters, he was not Zodiac any longer
Rehab says to  (03:44:56):
then he disappeared for good within the year
tracers says to  (03:45:00):
well btk stopped for a long time

DB Cooper was to "classy" to be Z

btk was a family man

Not to change the subject of the zodiac chat to something related to the zodiac, but I'm just cerous (^_^) how everyone feels about Graysmith? I just became obsessed with the case within the last year and it is due in large part to his book. Do you guys dislike him for his misinformation or appreciate him for bringing more eyes  to the case?
Starless says to  (03:48:37):
Seems like there's nothing to say about the Lake Berryessa thing though
Starless says to  (03:48:52):
I think we've all talked to ourselves to death about it
Roz says to  (03:48:53):
did something happen there???
Rehab says to  (03:48:56):
Well I am biased because I sued him
Starless says to  (03:48:58):
the wingwalker prints
Starless says to  (03:49:05):
the depth of those prints
Starless says to  (03:49:11):
the writing on the car door
mulhollandvelvet says to  (03:49:19):
That's interesting.
Shawn says to  (03:49:21):
Only sue rich people
Roz says to  (03:49:22):
Graysmith plays GTA 5 in the nude.
Rehab says to  (03:49:29):
regarding Lake Berryessa, there are two things I noticed that Detective Narlow was impressed with
Benicia Boy says to  (03:49:33):
Graysmith's dad is the Zodiac
colette says to  (03:49:38):
what?
colette says to  (03:49:50):
what 2 things
a9e8qd says to  (03:49:59):
@mulh...: he books were easy to get ahold of when i was younger. that helped me "get into" the case
puma says to  (03:50:00):
graysmith wrote a book,that was badly written,full of mistakes and did even care of do proper research on his subjects or the z killings..
a9e8qd says to  (03:50:07):
but like most kids, i got older
a9e8qd says to  (03:50:13):
and learned santa wasnt real
mulhollandvelvet says to  (03:50:23):
The irony...
a9e8qd says to  (03:50:27):
i matured and found zkiller.net
a9e8qd says to  (03:50:32):

a9e8qd says to  (03:50:33):
lol
Starless says to  (03:50:40):
Rehab.............
puma says to  (03:50:41):
but he liked the attention and PR,he was  a media whore...
puma says to  (03:50:42):
lol
Roz says to  (03:50:42):
I matured and found youjizz.com
Rehab says to  (03:50:45):
First thing, the writing on the Karmann Ghia door went all the way to the bottom of the door, which sits very close to the ground to begin with. Zodiac didn't hesitate to get his knees dirty. I would have written somewhere like the hood or the roof.
a9e8qd says to  (03:50:55):
hahahahahahahahaha Roz
Roz says to  (03:51:15):
he could have done a hand stand and wrote on the door.
colette says to  (03:51:15):
but he may have been crouching to avoid being seen
Starless says to  (03:51:26):
but he was trying to stay out of sight too probably
Rehab says to  (03:51:32):
Secondly, the sunbathing women who encountered the strange man...if it was Zodiac he likely would have left wing walker prints in th sand. Narlow aid they hadn't thought to check
Rehab says to  (03:51:46):
Colette cars can be heard there from a good distance
ebecker says to  (03:51:59):
As can farts.
colette says to  (03:52:03):
true but if a hiker was about
Shawn says to  (03:52:05):
Was Narlow the lead detective at LB?
Rehab says to  (03:52:10):
yes
Benicia Boy says to  (03:52:21):
The thing that bugged me most about Graysmith is that he called him "Zodiac" instead of "the Zodiac"... pet peeve
puma says to  (03:52:27):
hi ebecker and hello colotte and shawn and roz and 1938qd
Rehab says to  (03:52:31):
In that case I would have written at the top of the door. I don't get dirty if I can help it

good point colette
Starless says to  (03:53:31):
I wonder if he parked right by his victim's car
mulhollandvelvet says to  (03:53:50):
Well what does the fact that didn't want to get dirty say then?
Rehab says to  (03:53:56):
Perhaps, but I think it's a mindset. Like mechanics, they don't even notice or give it a second thought
Starless says to  (03:54:01):
Does anyone know where they were before they went to the lake?
puma says to  (03:54:03):
now for some Z related background music,they played during the z movie.it was one of my favorite songs..lol

puma says to  (03:55:05):
(H)
puma says to  (03:55:28):
I like that song..
colette says to  (03:55:34):
right
ebecker says to  (03:55:34):
Exactly Puma, I've been saying for years, if we can just find the damn guy that that song follows around, we'll find Zodiac.
Rehab says to  (03:55:39):
In the media player to the lower-right of the chat screen, I have loaded an assortment of Zodiac-related songs and videos you can play
a9e8qd says to  (03:55:48):
do you think somewhere, hidden, is the outfit from LB? or do you think it was destryoed/
puma says to  (03:55:52):
ebeck.i agree...lol
a9e8qd says to  (03:55:54):
destroyed
Starless says to  (03:56:01):
Does anyone know where Bryan and Cecelia were before they went to the lake?
Rehab says to  (03:56:03):

Shawn says to  (03:56:03):
Tom, were you friends with Narlow?
Rehab says to  (03:56:07):

mulhollandvelvet says to  (03:56:17):
I was hoping that youtube video was gonna be Marvin Gaye.
Rehab says to  (03:56:21):
Starless they were in Angwin
puma says to  (03:56:27):
actually i forget during the Zodiac killer movie,when the song was played now..
Shawn says to  (03:56:29):
You think he told you everything he knew?
puma says to  (03:56:31):
anyone remember?
Starless says to  (03:56:31):
what were they doing?
a9e8qd says to  (03:56:32):
i cant help but think its hidden in a staircase somewhere
Rehab says to  (03:56:39):
garage sale
a9e8qd says to  (03:56:41):

a9e8qd says to  (03:56:53):

Starless says to  (03:56:56):

Rehab says to  (03:57:02):

puma says to  (03:57:04):
there was mistakes in the movie,but i still liked the movie..and filming on location etc..and acting..

yeah..i think,i was eager for any new movie myself
puma says to  (03:58:04):
breaths..
mulhollandvelvet says to  (03:58:06):
Only problem I have with the film is the cinematography.
Benicia Boy says to  (03:58:06):
Like most "true stories" out of Hollywood, there was great attention to minute details but lots of license taken regarding what actually happened
Rehab says to  (03:58:10):
wht if you had not only grown out of the legos, but having them could get you the gas chamber?
Shawn says to  (03:58:15):
The Zodiac movie felt like that era
tracers says to  (03:58:17):
wasn't tjhat song playing when dee and mike were in the car?
eastjersey says to  (03:58:23):

Benicia Boy says to  (03:58:58):
like Argo, that movie was brilliant but BS at the same time
puma says to  (03:59:01):
indeed
Shawn says to  (03:59:17):
I wonder if Narlow was sure he got the right guy for Linda Kane murder
a9e8qd says to  (03:59:36):
did anyone see the other Z movie, came out a little before "big" one
puma says to  (03:59:44):
yes
a9e8qd says to  (03:59:46):
where they like, kick in some guys door
a9e8qd says to  (03:59:53):

Rehab says to  (03:59:54):
The woodcutter confessed
Roz says to  (03:59:56):
That piece of shit made by that Uli guy?
puma says to  (04:00:04):
it was a long time ago.i can't remember that much about to me honest..
Benicia Boy says to  (04:00:10):
The one where he jacks that old lady over the head with a tire iron?
a9e8qd says to  (04:00:16):

Rehab says to  (04:00:18):

Z had his drlvers licence.it must have creepy for mrs stine and his family
Dr Nash says to  (04:37:44):
i did tom
Rehab says to  (04:37:45):
I never had my wisdom teeth removed, and they wre all still under the gumline, and in mid-June one of them exploded because it had a cavity and got infected when I stabbed it with a cracker while chewing. The roots were wrapped around my sinus passage and the surgery was evasive
puma says to  (04:37:53):
yes sorry.who is charged with murder rehab?
colette says to  (04:38:04):
wow
puma says to  (04:38:15):
sorry rehab,is healed now
Dahlia says to  (04:38:35):
surgery was evasive? you just couldn't pinpoint it?
a9e8qd says to  (04:38:37):
Tom, that sounds HORRIBLE
butterfield says to  (04:38:39):
http://www.zodiackillerfacts.com   greatest website of alltime

did they put you to sleep.i had my impacked wisdom teeth removed,the first 2 in about 1978
Rehab says to  (04:38:57):
when I inally went to the dentist he said it was ozzing puss and he couldn't help me except to prescrive me vicodan and the anti-infection stuff
Dr Nash says to  (04:39:02):

k trace
Dahlia says to  (04:39:23):
ah finally we hear the cracker story
Rehab says to  (04:39:23):
Dahlia it was evasive because of the impaction and the roots being in the wrong place
Angie says to  (04:39:39):
(it was as gross as it sounds)
Dahlia says to  (04:39:40):
those roots sound Cthulhu-esque
puma says to  (04:39:45):
rehab
mj says to  (04:39:50):
try never to stab your teeth with crackers when chewing
Shawn says to  (04:39:51):
wow...hard to walk away from that 100 percent
puma says to  (04:40:06):
was the tooth removed,is the infection gone.did they finally do oral surgery
Rehab says to  (04:40:24):
Paul's great nephew, Mac C Stine has been arrested and charged with murder
Angie says to  (04:40:24):
I continued to beat him until his morale improved, Shawn :)
puma says to  (04:40:25):
i have had dental work,and i know how how hard it is
Dr Nash says to  (04:40:29):
that's good to hear. when i saw something you had health issue. i thought it was something very serious. like was in accident or something
Dahlia says to  (04:40:30):
I had mine pulled long ago....the doctor had a freshly broken leg and couldn't get one out. I had visions of him falling over and breaking the other leg
colette says to  (04:40:55):
infected teeth are serious they can kill you
puma says to  (04:40:59):
really rehab, about his great uncle,,how did you find about that ?
Angie says to  (04:41:08):
True that, Col
puma says to  (04:41:09):
the news  ?
tracers says to  (04:41:11):
accused of killing whom?
Rehab says to  (04:41:13):
yes Puma, had the surgery July 2 finally, my summer was shot but I never took the heavy painkillers, just Ibuprofin, and I haven't had one since July ended
colette says to  (04:41:37):
the infection makes your blood sticky and more suseptible to clots.. then heart attack
puma says to  (04:41:51):
i had a infection and oral surgery about 3 years ago on a tooth

I think Rader is sicker than Daumer
weeza says to  (05:13:38):
I'm good, just busy working. I'm exhibiting my jewelry at the fall festival next week, so all my free time is going to that
colette says to  (05:13:49):
im great weeza how are you???
Angie says to  (05:13:54):
He is, Shawn.. at least Dahmer was remorseful after the fact
puma says to  (05:13:55):
i think it was tom that say rader enjoys his serial killer status in prison now
Dr Nash says to  (05:14:13):
i watched a special btk on a&3 when they did docs well. oppose to be reality tv. they showed rayder was more agressive and using his authority to hurt people. like putting down this persons dog and stuff without giving a warning
puma says to  (05:14:18):
i would to throw into the general prison population myself,to live..
*** (05:14:40):Welcome to ZODIACKILLER.COM CHAT , ZBuff!
puma says to  (05:14:41):
i say put into the general prison population..
weeza says to  (05:14:42):
I just wish Rader would fade into obscurity, in prison and in the minds of the public. It's the best punishment for him
Shawn says to  (05:15:06):
Rader was a sick puppy
puma says to  (05:15:07):
and lets see what the other inmates will do to him
weeza says to  (05:15:16):
Dahmer was severely mentally ill and knew he was, Rader is just an egotiistical ass
puma says to  (05:15:21):
and still is
Dahlia says to  (05:15:22):
His daughter seems to be doing well. I always felt sad for her. How horrible to have that for a Dad.
Rehab says to  (05:15:23):
weeza!
ZBuff says to  (05:15:29):
Is there any way to get reports on Rader in prison?
Angie says to  (05:15:39):
Weez, same with Ridgway.. he's coming out of the cracks to claim more victims now (i/e: rekindle his good ole days_
Dr Nash says to  (05:15:45):
rayder along with and ons will be up there for the fear they caused. if you do the research it scary how scared people got from those three
Shawn says to  (05:15:47):
Is there any info on Rader parents?
weeza says to  (05:15:51):
Hi Rehab :)
Rehab says to  (05:15:51):
lolol
ZBuff says to  (05:16:15):
Agree with Shawn- What about Rader's mom?
puma says to  (05:16:22):
they allways claiming more victims, quite oftne there is.i think they want to get to relive the killings inside...to get off on it
colette says to  (05:16:34):
i think ridgeway came out because he is jealous of attention keyes got
Angie says to  (05:16:35):
Roz has some skeelz
Angie says to  (05:16:42):
i'm loling over here
Dahlia says to  (05:16:45):
re Ridgway--also, more practically, to get more $$ from letter-writers
weeza says to  (05:16:48):
I agree Angie, Ridgeway juyst wants the attention and to go out on field trips. I am SURE there are more victims, but I doubt he'd give any real info
Rehab says to  (05:16:48):
Roz I think the voice of Elmo might have been inspired by your Photoshop skills
tracers says to  (05:16:49):
roz do you make these pix?  they are hilarious
Dahlia says to  (05:16:53):
I think that motivates them as much as wanting attention
Roz says to  (05:17:04):
yes,I made them.
Dahlia says to  (05:17:11):
b/c if they don't have wealthy family to send them money, they have to 'earn' it from the public

Dahlia says to  (05:20:11):
yeah, he hassled the guy until he killed him, was what other inmates said...'suicide by paranoid schizophrenic'
weeza says to  (05:20:11):
I always felt badly for his dad Lionel

Rehab says to  (05:20:51):
howdy nancy
weeza says to  (05:20:52):
Badly I hope, but I heard rumors of him getting frisky pen pals
Dahlia says to  (05:20:56):
last I heard badly...he's probably glad Ramirez is dead b/c purportedly Ramirez hated him and was always trying to stab him
nancydrew says to  (05:21:00):
hi all
Dahlia says to  (05:21:02):
heard he succeeded one time
Shawn says to  (05:21:11):
Be a good plot for a movie.....a Serial killer escapes from a maximum security lab where his bite will turn the victims into serial killers
Rehab says to  (05:21:13):
God Bless Ramirez, just this once
weeza says to  (05:21:15):
Ramirez stabbed Peterson?
puma says to  (05:21:15):
he drowned his wife i think in the pool,then dumped the body in the ocean
weeza says to  (05:21:23):
WOW
Dahlia says to  (05:21:28):
I heard that from a San Quentin guard yes
Dahlia says to  (05:21:32):
a few yrs back
Angie says to  (05:21:42):
that must have scared the living shit out of Peterson
weeza says to  (05:21:43):
hmm, I never thought I'd cheer him on
weeza says to  (05:21:48):
Too bad
Dahlia says to  (05:21:49):
yes hahaha it did
Angie says to  (05:21:50):
I'm really glad for that if its true
Rehab says to  (05:21:54):
Richard Ramirez had more natural charisma than most rock stars
Dahlia says to  (05:21:55):
I know right, Weez
Tahoe27 says to  (05:22:02):
Ramirez was actually good for something...
Dahlia says to  (05:22:07):
yeah I think it was true...a 2nd source there confirmed it a while back
Shawn says to  (05:22:07):
more than Ted Bundy?
nancydrew says to  (05:22:13):
and was a talented artist as well
Rehab says to  (05:22:24):
I think so, by far. Also, when was Bundy a rock star?
Dahlia says to  (05:22:24):
that's the good thing about taking classes in Crim Justice at a place w/a police and corrections academy lol
Dahlia says to  (05:22:26):
gossip
Angie says to  (05:22:43):
Bundy had his own charm and magnetism though, for sure
Roz says to  (05:22:49):
here's Dahmer's killer. I didn't realize he killed another inmate in the same incident. http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Christopher_Scarver
Angie says to  (05:22:51):
plus, he had to have smelled better than Ramirez
Rehab says to  (05:22:56):
yess, but in a honky kinda way
Dahlia says to  (05:22:58):
lololol
weeza says to  (05:22:59):
Ahh, sadly I took CJ classes online
Dahlia says to  (05:23:09):
expensive cologne he shoplifted prolly
nancydrew says to  (05:23:22):
spiff and i visited dahmer's house or where it stood about 2 weeks ago
Dr Nash says to  (05:23:22):
i think a lot of inmates are rubbed the wrong way by them. sadly killers have morals. something disgusting like how one guy did something terrible how he raped and crossed the line. that wpuld set off an killer in prision.. more so it is the pedophiles or child killers that die from the hands of inmates who are offened by what they did
nancydrew says to  (05:23:32):
very creepy
puma says to  (05:23:33):
 i heard polly klaus's killer,,richard david..some prisoners got to him, unfortunately they pulled them away to soon..he is blamed for the 3 strikes law in california by them,besides being a sick child killer
Dahlia says to  (05:23:34):

Benicia Boy says to  (05:35:42):
Just a replica Zodiac hood I made when I was young and stupid
colette says to  (05:35:53):

jabberwocky says to  (05:36:40):
has anyone seen any good movies lately?
weeza says to  (05:36:44):
I wondered about that Nash
Rehab says to  (05:36:48):
hi jabber
davidmm5356 says to  (05:36:49):
Manson was almost a Beach Boy
jabberwocky says to  (05:36:56):
hello
davidmm5356 says to  (05:37:00):
Actually, I loved Insidious2
Rehab says to  (05:37:01):
Jabber I saw a Dahmer documentary that was good
Paradice says to  (05:37:04):
I dunno, I kinda think Manson was determined to fail
colette says to  (05:37:11):
it talks all about the recording contract stuff in there too
Benicia Boy says to  (05:37:13):
Best Manson song is Garbage Dump. Check it out
Tahoe27 says to  (05:37:17):
tracers---the red line is not through it....do i want the red line going through it?
Rehab says to  (05:37:18):
Mostly I watch Gunsmoke
Paradice says to  (05:37:28):
he would have taken out on someone else imho
davidmm5356 says to  (05:37:35):
Jabberwocky, I hear that Gravity is fantastic, and that it's a must-see in 3D
Tahoe27 says to  (05:37:37):
rehab - will go mention chat at morfs...if you're serious.
judith says to  (05:37:37):
Mud is good, Beasts of the Southern Wild is excellent
jabberwocky says to  (05:37:39):
burt renolds
weeza says to  (05:37:45):
I think part of his problem is that Mason was lazy and wanted the easy way to fame...he was doomed to fail because of it
Rehab says to  (05:37:49):
sure am serious
jabberwocky says to  (05:37:56):
i saw prisoners
jabberwocky says to  (05:38:04):
last saturday
Rehab says to  (05:38:05):
no Welsh Chappie though lol
Paradice says to  (05:38:06):
bingo, weeza
Tahoe27 says to  (05:38:08):
ok
colette says to  (05:38:17):
his mom wasnt a hooker
Dr Nash says to  (05:38:18):
my favourite quote from a serial kiler is from manson. ' they put me behind bars. i have neen behind my bars most of my life. all they did was put back at home.
Rehab says to  (05:38:20):
I didn't know they hd a chat
Dr Nash says to  (05:38:28):
 just paraphrasing
judith says to  (05:38:34):
Tahoe, if you want to stop the chat scroll you want the red line through it
colette says to  (05:38:36):
he grew up in a nice home
Paradice says to  (05:38:41):
old noname maddux or whatever
weeza says to  (05:38:44):
As soon as any fame Manson had faded he still would have gone completely mental
Rehab says to  (05:38:46):
Manson's "mother" dressed him as a girl for 1st grade
Benicia Boy says to  (05:38:49):
I like watching old clips of Manson scaring TV reporters during interviews by doing something unpredictable
Dahlia says to  (05:38:50):
Charles Manson has 'neen behind his bars'?
Rehab says to  (05:38:51):
he never had a chance
Dr Nash says to  (05:39:04):
*been
colette says to  (05:39:07):
lol rehab
Benicia Boy says to  (05:39:17):
Q: So, what's life like in prison?
jabberwocky says to  (05:39:22):
henry leee lucas mom dressed him in girls clothes to humilate him
Paradice says to  (05:39:29):
I think the same thing, W, and he would have taken it out on someone else eventually
davidmm5356 says to  (05:39:32):
fame would have been like another drug, he would have gotten bored with it, or killed himself because of it
Benicia Boy says to  (05:39:36):
A: well, we get up at 7 a.m. and go have breakfast and --- OOGA BOOGA BOOGA!
colette says to  (05:39:46):

weeza says to  (05:40:13):
Who was Tooles best friend?
jabberwocky says to  (05:40:15):
lol
Rehab says to  (05:40:20):
Otis was a Toole
weeza says to  (05:40:22):
Yeah, I thought it was lucas
Paradice says to  (05:40:32):
nice play on words
Dahlia says to  (05:40:34):
yes lucas
colette says to  (05:40:39):
they are both nasty
davidmm5356 says to  (05:40:40):
night benecia!
Rehab says to  (05:40:44):
I don't think he killed Adam Walsh, however
Rehab says to  (05:40:48):
either/or
jabberwocky says to  (05:40:48):
very punny
Paradice says to  (05:40:52):
neither do I
puma says to  (05:40:53):
night
weeza says to  (05:40:53):
He confessed supposedly to murdering Adam Walsh
colette says to  (05:41:03):
or was it dallhmer?
Rehab says to  (05:41:12):
Dahmer is nteresting
Paradice says to  (05:41:17):
I don't know why LE caved and announced Otis was the killer
weeza says to  (05:41:25):
Regardless of anyones feelings on John Walsh, I really wish that case would be solved
jabberwocky says to  (05:41:29):
oh ...that dahmer show where they look for a adam walsh connection
Paradice says to  (05:41:30):
interesting for the Walsh case?
colette says to  (05:41:36):
they had to pin it on someone
Dr Nash says to  (05:41:38):
i am more happy the walsh family has moved on.  if i had kids. i do not know how i would react outside being crushed if that happened to me
davidmm5356 says to  (05:41:39):
Was that the same conclusion that John Walsh reached in his book?
weeza says to  (05:41:42):
Dahmer was questioned and denied it
puma says to  (05:41:45):
i think i saw on TV adam walsh father from america's most wanted.thinks it was tool
Rehab says to  (05:41:46):
me too weeza, and I have nothing bad to say about John Walsh, he has been good to me
jabberwocky says to  (05:41:53):
some witness that claims they saw dhamer at the very smae mall  on the same day
puma says to  (05:41:57):
toole i mean
nancydrew says to  (05:42:08):
http://i467.photobucket.com/albums/rr32/nancydrewzchatter/zinsand.jpg  love letters in the sand
colette says to  (05:42:29):
nice
weeza says to  (05:42:41):
Yes, and Dahmer denied it. He admitted eating body parts and everything else...he had no reason to lie at that point. He didn't kill Adam
nancydrew says to  (05:42:42):
thanks
Paradice says to  (05:42:43):
it would be an odd departure in victimology for Dahmer imho
davidmm5356 says to  (05:42:44):
I cant imagine anyone would have been able to recogniz Dahmer from memory at a shopping mall. He was the very definition of "vanilla"
colette says to  (05:43:13):
wasnt one boy 14?
weeza says to  (05:43:15):
Yup, he faded into the background easily
davidmm5356 says to  (05:43:38):
I believe so, colette
jabberwocky says to  (05:43:44):
well the witness claims he that dahmer was starring at him
weeza says to  (05:43:45):
Yes colette, I believe so, but that's a huge emotional difference in victimology
puma says to  (05:43:54):
its getting later,I need to get off,i want to put my legs and rest and read
jabberwocky says to  (05:43:59):
yeah adam was too little

davidmm5356 says to  (05:48:56):
Elementary is a lot of fun.

Exactly Judith, a comedy of errors, and they would have been caught in under 5 mins'
judith says to  (05:49:55):
Momurda, you know nothing about Blaine
Rehab says to  (05:50:06):
I sure would love it if someone posted their challenges about Gyke as a suspect right now
davidmm5356 says to  (05:50:29):
Got something new, Rehab???
Rehab says to  (05:50:46):
No, except a lot of corrections of errors
weeza says to  (05:50:48):
I have no challenges, I'm just not 100% sold on any suspect, though Gyke is intriguing and worth study

Momurda says to  (05:54:32):

Rehab says to  (05:54:33):

jabberwocky says to  (05:54:49):

weeza says to  (05:54:50):
So...every task force meeting?
Momurda says to  (05:54:51):

Tahoe27 says to  (05:55:47):
rehab--i won't challenge him.  I know not enough.
Rehab says to  (05:56:08):
what does any of this have to do with posting serious questions about Gaikowski?
tracers says to  (05:56:08):
so great too see some of the old group again
Momurda says to  (05:56:14):
so ur not gonna admit to being sure of ala before being sure of gaik
Momurda says to  (05:56:15):

\??
Momurda says to  (05:56:31):
becuz i dont kno the date of when u last suspected him
jabberwocky says to  (05:56:51):
i don't get this
mulhollandvelvet says to  (05:56:53):
:-* this is a really cute smiley, i've never seen it.
Rehab says to  (05:57:04):
I was sure Allen was my best candidate of all the suspects I had knowledge of, which is what I always said, but that is not specific enough to make TV (television) happy
weeza says to  (05:57:11):
so this arguement is over a timing and assurances of guilt about a suspect?
Rehab says to  (05:57:35):
At first I thought it had to be Allen
judith says to  (05:57:41):
many did
davidmm5356 says to  (05:57:52):
Great to be back in chat! I've been gone too long
Momurda says to  (05:57:53):
so are you more or less convinced of gaik than allen?
tracers says to  (05:57:54):
get what jabbers?
Rehab says to  (05:58:02):
Then I started digging deeply, which you have never done Momurda
colette says to  (05:58:05):
true david
*** (05:58:05):ebecker quit the room
weeza says to  (05:58:05):
I don't recall Mr. Voigt ever posting "I am 100% sure ALA was the Zodiac" even when he still was the only top suspect available
colette says to  (05:58:20):
i feel the same way
jabberwocky says to  (05:58:20):
oh that was before i finsihed my tom collins tracers
weeza says to  (05:58:24):
He's always been open minded to an extent
Rehab says to  (05:58:27):
I never said 100%
Momurda says to  (05:58:40):
its not a trick quiestion
Momurda says to  (05:58:44):
lol
Momurda says to  (05:58:48):
just wondering
tracers says to  (05:58:50):
lol i just made a tini
judith says to  (05:58:55):
uh oh
weeza says to  (05:58:58):
no, you didn't, you said basically that he was the best supsect and looked good at the time
Rehab says to  (05:59:00):
in fact since 1995 there have only been 4 suspects I have ever felt were worthy of special attention
colette says to  (05:59:09):
who are you momurda?
*** (05:59:09):supernova8610 quit the room
Rehab says to  (05:59:16):
Welsh Chappie
Rehab says to  (05:59:18):
is he
davidmm5356 says to  (05:59:24):
A lot of people still think ALA was him, and books have supported that claim, and a very expensive movie was made with that basis. Why would it be of any significance if Rehab once agreed with them?
colette says to  (05:59:34):
right
judith says to  (05:59:42):
ah I have missed you so dmm
Rehab says to  (05:59:42):
the four suspects were (in order) Allen, Marshall, Sam, and Gyke
tracers says to  (05:59:45):
which 4 ala grant gaik and marshall?
tracers says to  (06:00:02):
ah yes I forgot about sam
Rehab says to  (06:00:07):
never a Grant guy was I
Momurda says to  (06:00:15):
im just asking a question and btw im not that welsh moron
Rehab says to  (06:00:17):
I interviewed Grant twice though
jabberwocky says to  (06:00:18):
once the evidence is learned then there is just no dispute
weeza says to  (06:00:20):
I have no favorite suspect. Hell, if my husband was about 10 years older he'd make a great suspect
colette says to  (06:00:30):
lol weeza
tracers says to  (06:00:42):
ah ok tom thought maybe you did since LEiked grant even if it was lafferty''
davidmm5356 says to  (06:00:43):
I'e missed you too Judith! :-*
Rehab says to  (06:00:44):
Weeza, Baba would still be a bad suspect, even in 10 years
jabberwocky says to  (06:01:13):
no babas were harmed in tongihts chat
colette says to  (06:01:18):
lol
judith says to  (06:01:26):
hahahaha
Rehab says to  (06:01:27):
Grant spoke just like Mayor Quimby from The Simpson
weeza says to  (06:01:52):
He would! Former military guy with ddep ties to the bay area, knows all the obscure places throughout the bay area, he has interesting handwriting and is ambedextorous, the only problem is that he's nice and has no hatred of women, and he's too young
tracers says to  (06:01:53):
lolol
tracers says to  (06:02:06):
i thought ala was z too cuz the book said so

well thats good
tracers says to  (06:02:15):
i assuned all in the book was accurate
colette says to  (06:02:17):
hey 87
tracers says to  (06:02:23):
back in 1988 or so
Rehab says to  (06:02:23):
I have only liked 4 suspects enough to think they should be looked at more that just a background check
jabberwocky says to  (06:02:23):
but major quimby sounded like ted kennedy
weeza says to  (06:02:30):
Tracers, util I went online I was pretty sure it was ALA too
judith says to  (06:02:35):
so a question... any thoughts on why Hartnell will not give an opinion re Gaikowski's voice?
8727742 says to  (06:02:35):
hah my old nickname The411 turned into a number :P
davidmm5356 says to  (06:02:48):
So... people have been exicuted because they were the "best suspect and looked good at the time"... then later they've been proven innocent. People form opinions based on the best available knowledge. That's a discovery process.
Rehab says to  (06:02:51):
I have more suspects than all the police departments combined
8727742 says to  (06:03:02):
Here's another for you Rehab
8727742 says to  (06:03:12):
Born 1950
Rehab says to  (06:03:14):
Judith I have no ida and have tried to find out
Rehab says to  (06:03:25):
ok 872, shoot
8727742 says to  (06:03:31):
problem is it would rule out 1963
Benicia Boy says to  (06:03:38):
Rehab, who were the four?
8727742 says to  (06:03:39):
Domigos
Rehab says to  (06:03:48):
who was born in 1950?
Momurda says to  (06:03:50):
rehab is ala completely ruled out in ur book?
8727742 says to  (06:03:56):
graduated from Amador Valley HS
tracers says to  (06:04:06):
maybe hartnell feels unsure either way and doesn't want to say anything that might cause people to dig depper or stop digging
tracers says to  (06:04:39):
bb rehab said the 4 were ala marshall sam and gaik
jabberwocky says to  (06:04:47):
wwell the santa barbra case was never actually clarifed a definet zodiac case just possible
Rehab says to  (06:04:48):
ALA is not ruled-out completely until the fat lady sings
Benicia Boy says to  (06:04:56):
thanks Tracers
mulhollandvelvet says to  (06:05:00):
1950?
tracers says to  (06:05:10):
was graysmith born in 1950?
8727742 says to  (06:05:12):
yeah doesn't seem plausible
Rehab says to  (06:05:27):
who was born in 1950?
8727742 says to  (06:05:35):
the real question is how old was Zodiac at Berryessa?
davidmm5356 says to  (06:05:43):
Despite the fact that no DNA nor fingerprints, etc, match ALA... he can't be ruled out
Rehab says to  (06:05:51):
I believe Zodiac was in his 30s most likely, FWIW
Paradice says to  (06:06:04):
so do I
judith says to  (06:06:18):
not a youngster imo
tracers says to  (06:06:23):
rg born 1942
nancydrew says to  (06:06:34):
police repts in sf put poi older
Rehab says to  (06:06:42):
I do not believe Graysmith was involved, no
Momurda says to  (06:06:47):
whats the single  best piece of evidence against gaikowski?
tracers says to  (06:06:48):
me either
8727742 says to  (06:06:51):
Gaik looks very eerie
8727742 says to  (06:06:57):
in that mug shot
davidmm5356 says to  (06:07:02):
I've thought a LOT about the Hartnell response, especially since I spent all that effort cleaning up the audio and editing it down. Tracer's theory makes sense, but I also wonder why he didn't just say he didn't recognize it.
mulhollandvelvet says to  (06:07:03):
/case
Rehab says to  (06:07:41):
Momurda, one piece does not a case make, since we don't have physical evidnce. So no dice.
mulhollandvelvet says to  (06:07:41):
I missed tracers' theory :(
Paradice says to  (06:07:54):
yeah, I wish he would have commented one way or the other
judith says to  (06:08:08):
yess dmm, trace's answer has logic to it but I don't understand either why he couldn't simply say "I'm not sure"
8727742 says to  (06:08:10):
What was Hartnell being querried about?
Paradice says to  (06:08:14):
even if it was "I don't  know"
judith says to  (06:08:19):
his silence is frustrating
Paradice says to  (06:08:25):
yess
davidmm5356 says to  (06:08:35):
Tracers said, "maybe harnell feels unsure either way and doesn't want to say anytihng that might cause people to dig deeper or stop digging"
Momurda says to  (06:08:35):
 rehab- top 3?
Rehab says to  (06:08:36):
my only idea about Hartnell is he thought it sounded familiar but he knew that didn't mean shit since he was a lawyer
mulhollandvelvet says to  (06:09:23):
thank you
mulhollandvelvet says to  (06:09:32):
top 25?

dirty work, but somebody's gotta do it

the fact that wednesdays were the busiest and the only day z didnt send a letter was on wed

don't know if they have a poi or not i rarely read morf's
weeza says to  (06:22:36):
I'm sure many of the still existing evidence samples would have dna so degraded it can't yield results, but it should still be done. I wonder about the cost and lab time though, since current cases have priority
Rehab says to  (06:22:38):
lolol

When Tom and I were putting together the Mystery Quest show, they had the BEST DNA lab in the country AND the budget to retest the DNA and the SFPD refused to take them up on the offer

Hi scott
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:24:24):
Scott!
Rehab says to  (06:24:24):
scott_n???
scott_n says to  (06:24:36):
in the flesh
Rehab says to  (06:24:57):
no f'n way
*** (06:25:05):stevenp quit the room
weeza says to  (06:25:14):
that's sad David...professional jealousy/territorialism?
davidmm5356 says to  (06:25:20):
I suppose
scott_n says to  (06:25:23):
yes f'n way
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:25:28):
was it sent through proper channels?
Rehab says to  (06:25:50):
scott, did you not drive a mini van at Lake Berryessa 10 years ago?
tracers says to  (06:26:03):
that sucks davidmm
Paradice says to  (06:26:06):
seems like SFPD just wants the Z case to go away
tracers says to  (06:26:08):
and makes no sense
scott_n says to  (06:26:11):
no  a piece of shit Payless compact
*** (06:26:18):guest quit the room
davidmm5356 says to  (06:26:29):
To watch them cut up the letters in the old DNA test... makes me shiver. They wouldn't have to do anthing that destructive now
jabberwocky says to  (06:26:31):
a pinto?
Rehab says to  (06:26:40):
Scott...
weeza says to  (06:26:50):
brb, stepson woke up
scott_n says to  (06:26:53):
a Metro I believe
davidmm5356 says to  (06:27:03):
yes it was sent through proper channels, at least that's what the producer told me, and she was VERY motivated to make it work
judith says to  (06:27:18):
only way it makes sense to me is if the SFPD lab has lost and/or contaminated evidence
scott_n says to  (06:27:26):
and a funny story I heard a GIANT crashing in my cabin at 4 am, never figured out what it was
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:27:29):
damn then that really sucks.
Rehab says to  (06:27:32):
I was with a Scott N at lake B back in 2003 or 2004 who was driving a minivan and we also visited the Zodiac Shack site
tracers says to  (06:27:56):
cool hi scott n
davidmm5356 says to  (06:28:16):
We gave them theDNA profile that we developed from Gyke, and the SFPD refused to compare it to the Zodiac fragment. Refused. Why not check and say, "It does't match??"
tracers says to  (06:28:20):
so scott n took the pix of you  at the zodiac shack?
Rehab says to  (06:28:39):
no I took those b & w pics
scott_n says to  (06:28:44):
yes I remeber that spooky
tracers says to  (06:28:46):
yes davidmm makes NO sense
judith says to  (06:28:47):
idk dmm
scott_n says to  (06:28:55):
anyway on the presnet, what is going on with DNA
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:28:56):
yeah really dmm that bites .
Rehab says to  (06:29:08):
nothing Scott
tracers says to  (06:29:19):
aren't all the z letters at doj now?
davidmm5356 says to  (06:29:20):
It's the same response that Hartnell gave. No response.
judith says to  (06:29:22):
wish the doj showed interest again, perhaps they could force the issue
Rehab says to  (06:29:44):
Judith that is in new effect
scott_n says to  (06:29:45):
Hartnell well..there's somethin not right there in my numble opinion
nancydrew says to  (06:30:06):
doj wrote me and referred me to napa and fbi
judith says to  (06:30:11):
and there was a lot of work and effort and money put into History Channel show
nancydrew says to  (06:30:15):
out of funding they said
Rehab says to  (06:30:19):
Having met Scott N, I wish he was more assertive in our Z commnity
scott_n says to  (06:30:30):
I'm a lurker Tom
Tahoe27 says to  (06:30:31):
who did the dna testing for "sam"?  Or did it not go that far? Can't remember...
8727742 says to  (06:30:39):
What about FOIA for zodiac files?
scott_n says to  (06:30:41):
a careful lurker
nancydrew says to  (06:30:46):
that was within last 6 months
tracers says to  (06:30:54):
doj did sam iirc
Rehab says to  (06:31:02):
I know Scott, but you are a good one
davidmm5356 says to  (06:31:03):
It makes me thik that everyone from the case is going to have to be dead and gone, and then it might finally get enough distance for people to stop blocking the progress

hello sandy
davidmm5356 says to  (06:33:04):
Well, Rehab,you're yong and spry and wasn't involved with the case. The people who ARE from the case keep getting blocked by ... something
scott_n says to  (06:33:16):
Ok Tom just one question I promise.  What is your take on Tarbox?
sandy betts says to  (06:33:16):
I just got back from lake B
weeza says to  (06:33:18):
Hi Sandy
sandy betts says to  (06:33:36):
Hi Weeza

sandy betts says to  (06:33:51):
LOL
Tahoe27 says to  (06:33:55):
thx tracers.  has the doj looked at gaikowki if they have dna stuff?
tracers says to  (06:34:00):
bbiam
weeza says to  (06:34:05):
I would've loved to have been out at lake B today. As sad as the crime was and is, it's beautiful there

hello sanddy
scott_n says to  (06:34:20):
did anyone go?
tracers says to  (06:34:30):
don't think doj has done anythng re gyke  not sure there is any gyke dna
sandy betts says to  (06:34:38):
I played a joke on some Z people that went to the lake today
*** (06:34:49):colette quit the room
weeza says to  (06:34:52):
do tell
tracers says to  (06:34:58):
the tv show got some dna from loomis letters, but not sure how to prove or disprove the dna is gyke dna
davidmm5356 says to  (06:35:21):
Tracers, for the Mystery Quest show, we used an envelop from one of Gyke's personal letters, and the DNA lab returned a profile of a male. So, that's what we had to offer.
sandy betts says to  (06:35:46):
I made a copy of the costume while at the lake and had it on when some people were down at the crime scene. It scared them very much !
tracers says to  (06:35:50):
ah ok i thought there was combo male female dna
tracers says to  (06:35:54):
i am foggy
tracers says to  (06:35:55):
lol
davidmm5356 says to  (06:36:10):
He has relatives, so if we had a good Z profile,the could be used for family-matching
Tahoe27 says to  (06:36:14):
sorry--misunderstood, I thought dmm said they took stuff to SFPD to compare.
tracers says to  (06:36:18):
did you know the peeps sandy?  do they post?
davidmm5356 says to  (06:36:24):
they found both male and female DNA
weeza says to  (06:36:27):
Were they at the right spot Sandy?
sandy betts says to  (06:36:32):
No I never saw them before
sandy betts says to  (06:36:54):
Yes Narlow had shown them where it was yrs ago

jabberwocky says to  (06:37:14):
well if they were fans of yellow book they would of been on the other island

No they don't post they don't use computers

Tom I was asking about your take on Tarbox
jabberwocky says to  (06:39:36):
well if you didn't bring the gun to a knife fight i'm sure z would wait for you to go and get it
Rehab says to  (06:39:47):
I don't think Tarbox has anything
scott_n says to  (06:40:06):
well he has a crinkled face and a hideous sense of design
scott_n says to  (06:40:11):
he does have that!
judith says to  (06:40:20):
hahahaha
nancydrew says to  (06:40:23):
he knows oysters and martinis i can verify that

i prfer my martinis with olives but to each his own
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:41:15):
I will say this he would not budge on the story shit he would not even tell me anything else about the way the guy looked etc nothing
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:41:26):
tarvampirebox
sandy betts says to  (06:41:29):
I think that the Z could have stopped by to see Tarbox, but used a different name on the ID
jabberwocky says to  (06:41:42):
or what?we will forver hear the word titwillow for the rest of our lives
scott_n says to  (06:41:58):
that is interesting to me.  if he were a huckster you'd think he would be dropping little crumbs to keep people coming into his circus tent
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:42:26):
yeah I dont think he`s bullshittin or trying to make some duckets
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:42:30):
know what im sayin
judith says to  (06:42:47):
did you know that Gaikowski raised birds as pets?

These guys! They're literary geniuses cause the world's most obvious Lewis Carroll reference is in there.

hi all-finally made it!

ok one other stupid question, what the hell happened with Allen Cutshall murders?  Turn out the lights the party's over!
Paradice says to  (06:48:39):
wasn't that homeless guy suspected?
Paradice says to  (06:49:06):
cookie bandit or something?

Paradice, Did yo know that Tarbox once lived in Vallejo ?
Paradice says to  (06:49:43):
no, I did not
tracers says to  (06:49:49):
hi ratman!
sandy betts says to  (06:50:08):
He lived with the chief of police in Vallejo
nancydrew says to  (06:50:09):
graduated from vallejo hs
Paradice says to  (06:50:12):
I don't know anything about tarbox, other than he was a lawyer in the bay area
scott_n says to  (06:50:14):
Sandy I think Tarbox is a creepy dude and that alone makes me suspect...
tracers says to  (06:50:15):
i think tarbox was telling the truth  but who knows if the guy was zodiac or just a nut
ratman says to  (06:50:15):
was just at the Gaviota site-very secluded
Paradice says to  (06:50:19):
and was disbarred iirc
nancydrew says to  (06:50:21):
4 years before ala
scott_n says to  (06:50:42):
not disbarred, "disciplined" for embezzlement of client funds
nancydrew says to  (06:50:45):
tb graduated early
scott_n says to  (06:50:46):
and he left town
sandy betts says to  (06:50:53):
I think it could be Zodiac playing around
nancydrew says to  (06:51:06):
nawww tbs not z
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:51:07):
well he did say that could have been a possiblity too so yeah who knows but i still think that the guy knew too much about stine.
Paradice says to  (06:51:12):
tracers, I think he was probably telling the truth, but the guy who told tbox the story, who knows
*** (06:51:34):Welcome to ZODIACKILLER.COM CHAT , Rehab!
sandy betts says to  (06:51:38):
I didn't say tha Tarbox was the Z ?????
tracers says to  (06:51:42):
he did say what was a ;possibility and who knew too much about stine?
scott_n says to  (06:51:45):
I actually believe Tarbox's story but there's obviously more to it than that
Rehab says to  (06:51:46):
back for fuck's sake
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:51:48):
i asked him if the guy talked about other crimes or vics he just said no just the stine case.
Paradice says to  (06:51:55):
wb
tracers says to  (06:51:56):
sorry i am tired eyes hurt and i am not following well

so u fucken talk to this guy for what 4 hours and u cant give me a better description ? lol
Paradice says to  (06:52:06):
for fucks sake
scott_n says to  (06:52:07):
SPF when did you talk to Tarbox
nancydrew says to  (06:52:27):
2 years ago
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:52:30):
me and nancy drew talked to him for like  afew hours .
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:52:54):
we were somewhere in vegas when the zodiac drugs began to take hold!!!
nancydrew says to  (06:52:57):
like 5 hours over "cocktails"
nancydrew says to  (06:53:08):

i abstain from hell liquid.
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:53:24):
lol
scott_n says to  (06:53:25):
although probably given the wrong name I suspect he might have some other id item
Paradice says to  (06:53:28):
how is it breaking att/client priv to give a description of a guy, but not to tell the substance of his conversation?
sandy betts says to  (06:53:43):
Did yu show him any suspect pictures ?
nancydrew says to  (06:53:49):
yes mine
Tahoe27 says to  (06:53:52):
anyone who says they know who zodiac is and won't tell needs to have their boxtar-ed.
davidmm5356 says to  (06:54:11):
Agreed Paradice
serialprofilingfan says to  (06:54:35):
yeah
sandy betts says to  (06:54:41):
The poor guy is so old he probab ly forgot what he looked like and the name
nancydrew says to  (06:54:46):
i asked him that considerling his partner is now deceased
nancydrew says to  (06:55:12):
no he seemed surprised
scott_n says to  (06:55:27):
unless he had some reason to fear I would think he'd provide an id
nancydrew says to  (06:55:43):
wouldnt say anything but he definitely looked long and hard at the photo
sandy betts says to  (06:56:17):
Thanks Nancy d
scott_n says to  (06:57:02):
Hell it's 40 years or so
scott_n says to  (06:57:08):

I asked him about gaik and he said it was not him in his opinion not the guy in his office that night  nor was it any other poi`s he has seen.
nancydrew says to  (06:57:37):
true but hedid talk with the poi supposedly for a few hours
scott_n says to  (06:57:54):
true
*** (06:58:05):ebecker quit the room
scott_n says to  (06:58:26):
what did poi supposedly say about the stine case that was so galvinizing
Tahoe27 says to  (06:58:59):
why say anything at all?  A little late steppin' in to clear ALA/
Paradice says to  (06:58:59):
that is why I could never be a lawyer, I wouldn't be able to live with myself knowing or thinking someone who did such things was roaming around free

isn't there something that clears you of that if the person is capable of murdering people?  almost like aidind and abedding...(sp?)
scott_n says to  (07:00:36):
you can thank Fincher for that though I think
nancydrew says to  (07:00:44):
he knew rank on the mm card
Tahoe27 says to  (07:00:48):
....b..y..e.. weeza
sandy betts says to  (07:00:58):
Paradice , he didn't want people to thin k that ALA was Zodiac , because he wasn't
davidmm5356 says to  (07:01:06):
considering what ALA  was convicted for, it's not like his name is being sullied by Zodiac rumors
Paradice says to  (07:01:13):
I know psychiatrists are required to report if a person is a danger to others
nancydrew says to  (07:01:17):
also some other details as to his background
ratman says to  (07:01:18):
Mike M ever show?
Paradice says to  (07:01:20):
not sure about lawyers
Paradice says to  (07:01:23):
or priestts
tracers says to  (07:01:35):
right para
scott_n says to  (07:01:46):
lawyers aren't unless there is an imminent crime or they actually cover up a crime in progress
Tahoe27 says to  (07:02:06):
too many rules protecting potential bad guys. And if they aren't guilty....so what!
sandy betts says to  (07:02:21):
I thi nk he was in fear of his family if he told
mulhollandvelvet says to  (07:02:28):
If they aren't guilty there will be a cloud hanging around their head for the rest of their lives.
mulhollandvelvet says to  (07:02:31):
It's not that simple.
nancydrew says to  (07:02:53):
it had more to do with his partner's family imo
scott_n says to  (07:03:07):
at this point I have to believe there is something stopping him from giving a physical description or other evidenece about the guy's id
nancydrew says to  (07:03:08):
i believe z was actually looking for jue
Paradice says to  (07:03:20):
jue?
Tahoe27 says to  (07:03:21):
he wouldn't have to post in on FB or take out an ad in the VTH.  he could have just gone to LE.
nancydrew says to  (07:03:27):
jue was tb
nancydrew says to  (07:03:32):
partner
Paradice says to  (07:03:42):
oh, I see
sandy betts says to  (07:03:43):
Yes I remember him saying that, but I thin k he was worried about his family as well.
nancydrew says to  (07:04:12):
tb didnt really have family, jue did
scott_n says to  (07:04:15):
he goes to law enforcement wtf are they going to do?  nothing...
nancydrew says to  (07:04:39):
i think z was there to see jue and tb stepped in
sandy betts says to  (07:04:40):
Oh he didn't have children ?
nancydrew says to  (07:04:50):
not to my knowlege
nancydrew says to  (07:04:59):
just x wives
mulhollandvelvet says to  (07:05:05):
I don't think it really works like that, but okay. I'm not defending him I'm just taking issue with the idea of accusing someone of serial killing being minor.
Paradice says to  (07:05:32):
say he was Z, and Tbox turned him in... what is he going to do to Tbox or Jue from prison
scott_n says to  (07:06:12):
the thing that strikes me is it's such an odd story it rings true somewhat and it's hard to see a motive for coming forward when you're in your 80s.  by that time any grandiosity or need for pr is usually dead and buried
sandy betts says to  (07:06:16):
Turning him in would have taken a long time to put him behind bars
Paradice says to  (07:06:35):
I know whatt you are saying mvelvet, but people make false confessions all the time
Paradice says to  (07:06:46):
LE has to weed them out
tracers says to  (07:07:00):
well attorney client priv is a big deal to lawyers
tracers says to  (07:07:14):
yes sandy
Paradice says to  (07:07:19):
why was tbox disbarred?
mulhollandvelvet says to  (07:07:21):
Right, and again I don't know enough about the case to say anything (I'm just learning), I was reacting to the post that said "if he isn't guilty so what?'. That's all.
scott_n says to  (07:07:27):
he was NOT disbarred
Dahlia says to  (07:07:33):
embezzled $ from a client iirc
nancydrew says to  (07:07:36):
true and i dont know for sure who tb talked to was really z but theres more to it than then murders
scott_n says to  (07:07:38):
he was disciplined
ratman says to  (07:07:42):
did he really believe it was Z/
scott_n says to  (07:07:44):
big difference
Paradice says to  (07:07:53):
oh, I thought he could not practice in Cali for some reason
Paradice says to  (07:07:57):
my bad
tracers says to  (07:08:00):
i see mul  no worries
nancydrew says to  (07:08:01):
he embezzled money from a barber group paradice
scott_n says to  (07:08:03):
he was suspended
scott_n says to  (07:08:12):
temporarily
Tahoe27 says to  (07:08:12):
I don't think accusing someone of being a serial killer is minor, but if you think you KNOW your guy is a serial killer, I would think you would at least try and tell LE...all the other legal stuff aside.  I get the attorney/client stuff, but geesh....would he have kept quiet if it was btk??  Where does one draw the line for these psychos?!
Dahlia says to  (07:08:19):
yup
scott_n says to  (07:08:19):
then he went to Vegas
Paradice says to  (07:08:29):
anonymous tip
Dahlia says to  (07:08:37):
I wonder if his girlfriend' still alive
Dahlia says to  (07:08:41):
she's older than he is
nancydrew says to  (07:08:46):
he is disbarred scott got his disbarrment papers he cant practice law in california
nancydrew says to  (07:09:03):
she died in april dahlia
nancydrew says to  (07:09:10):
or around then
Paradice says to  (07:09:11):
like I said, I could never be a lawyer for precisely that reason
Dahlia says to  (07:09:14):
ty Nancy! haven't looked into TB in ages
nancydrew says to  (07:09:28):
alzheimers
Paradice says to  (07:09:39):
looking intto the tarbox
sandy betts says to  (07:09:48):
Dahlia, if she died we need to go and see Tarbox !
Dahlia says to  (07:09:48):
interesting. she seemed a bit off when we met her...histrionic
nancydrew says to  (07:09:51):
hes a cool guy
Dahlia says to  (07:09:55):
Sandy, too true
Dahlia says to  (07:10:02):
yes I liked Tarbox...so did Bill
scott_n says to  (07:10:23):
Tarbox was disbarred after refused to pay fees
mulhollandvelvet says to  (07:10:28):
Yeah, I mean it is tricky for sure. The flipside is that they help put people like that away for life. So it is a job with an obvious moral gray area but at the same time you can do a lot of great things.
scott_n says to  (07:10:37):
but I do believe his refusal was due to a prior suspension
scott_n says to  (07:10:44):
anyway it doesn't really matter
Dahlia says to  (07:10:47):
maybe he'll finally spill...he WANTED to talk about Z and she flipped out and shut him down. We had a feeling she held the power in the household for whatever reason...it was her house anyway
davidmm5356 says to  (07:11:19):
Yes! Get back there!! Interview him and record it!
sandy betts says to  (07:11:23):

hey question dahlia ...did bill ever get to view z evidence from vallejo? I was just wondering if he did since the whole domingos edwards thing was so creepy similar but yeah besides that i would have thought he could someone get in to view things back then.
serialprofilingfan says to  (08:24:58):
or maybe im confusing stuff and it was too late of a date and he could not technically check it out?
