Just a couple points of order before I get started:

1, Instead of adding a new page each time I add material to the site, I will do
what I've done on TZMS recently and consolidate as much as I can.  I will, for
example, be working on this Riverside chapter over a period of days or weeks,
so the reader may want to come back to it periodically to check for updates.

2, Rather than discussing more general investigational approaches separately, I
will talk about them as they come up in the course of examining the individual
incidents.

Every time I look at conventional aspects of the Zodiac murders, I eventually
come to the conclusion that I haven't looked closely enough at what's there,
and I decide to go back and up the magnification.

RRIIVV--0011
On Sunday morning, October 30, 1966, at 9am, Cheri Bates and her father, Joseph
Bates, attended Catholic mass at St. Catherine's Church on Brockton.



Although nothing that happens Sunday morning is directly related to the murder,
there are several observations we can make about the victim just from this
scant information so far.

Cheri Bates and I are both baptized Catholics.  Practicing Catholics are
required to attend mass every Sunday, and they are also required to attend mass
on Holy Days.  On Sunday, October 30, 1966, Cheri Bates knew she would be
returning to St. Catherine's within a couple days.

She could hardly have imagined that her next trip to St. Catherine's would be
for her own funeral.

Several investigators, including Robert Graysmith, have commented on Cheri
Bates having been murdered on the day before Halloween.  No one has pointed out
that she was murdered two days before All Saint's Day.

What does a Catholic Holy Day have to do with Cheri Bates's death?  It reminds
us that her life was ordered by the logistics of her schedule, her commitments
to family, friends, faith, employment, and education.

If you read Zodiac websites and message boards, you get the impression that the
Zodiac victims were like electrons in a subatomic world.  At any given point in
time, it was impossible to predict either their exact location or velocity
(speed plus direction).  The actions of the Zodiac victims were the ultimate
manifestation of Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle!

The actions of real people are predictable to an extent fledgling investigators
don't seem to recognize.  I'm retired, so I don't have a set schedule, but I
have to take my cat to the veterinarian twice a week because, at 14, she's
experiencing renal failure and has to take fluid from an IV, like a human going
for dialysis.  When I go out, which I do several times a week, I tend to visit
the same stores and very often buy the same things.  The baristas at my coffee
shop often start making my favorite drink when they see me in the front window.

People are predictable.  A magazine editor whose mail I delivered for years
wrote an editorial about how she spent all her time in only 3 of Pittsburgh's
neighborhoods (Squirrel Hill, Oakland, and Shadyside).  I'm sure there are
exceptions, but I think remarkable consistency is the rule for the vast
majority.

If you look at True Crime shows on TLC or Discovery ID, you will note that,
most of the time, the perpetrator tends to be the person who stepped OUT of his
daily routine for no apparent reason.  The victims, on the other hand, were
doing what they did every day, until that routine was interrupted.

I find the random musings of Zodiac message board posters exasperating.  Maybe
Cheri Bates went out for dinner by herself, even though she'd already eaten at
her house before she left that day?  Maybe she went for a drive with friends,
even though she'd told her father she was going to the library and had been
known to do that in the past, had even been photographed studying in the
library annex?  Maybe the outgoing, pretty blonde cheerleader tiptoed into The
RCC Library and kept to herself in some out-of-the-way corner of the building
for 2 hours and 40 minutes?

The fact is, there's no telling what happened to Cheri Bates that day . . .
unless, like me, you assume that Cheri Bates was Cheri Bates, and hadn't gone
through some alien transformation like the characters in Don Siegel's IInnvvaassiioonn
ooff tthhee BBooddyy SSnnaattcchheerrss.  The Cheri Bates you read about in Robert Graysmith's
ZZooddiiaacc, and in all other accounts of her murder, particularly those on Zodiac
websites, isn't the real Cheri Bates--it's her pod-person duplicate!  Maybe
Cheri fell asleep while the pod sprouted her double, and was then replaced by a
silent sleepwalker who LOOKED like Cheri Bates, but who ACTED like someone
else?

Cheri walked off into the dark with her killer, when her friends say she'd
NEVER have done that.  Cheri left her car unlocked with the windows down and
the keys in the ignition, when her fiance says she'd NEVER walk away from it
without locking it first.  Cheri was always phoning friends and leaving notes
for people, telling them what she was going to do, but after 6:15pm that night,
no one saw her or heard from her.

Cheri Bates was predictable, and she behaved in ways that were characteristic
of her--except that evening.

The True Crime accounts got the death right but the victim wrong.

RRIIVV--0022
After mass, Cheri and her dad ate breakfast at Sandy's Restaurant in The
Hardman Center,


just around the corner from their house at 4195 Via San Jose.


My thanks to Rembrandt from Tom Voigt's site for the photos of Riverside, which
are present day, not from 1966.

Rembrandt and others on Tom's site have pointed up another aspect of Cheri
Bates's movements on that day.  The patrons and employees at Sandy's
Restaurant, which has now been closed for over a decade, still remembered Cheri
Bates and the aftermath of her murder.  The Cheri Bates murder was the biggest
story in Riverside, and remains the most famous homicide in the city's
history.  It was even recalled that "Bob Barnett", who was the local suspect in
the murder until he was cleared by a DNA mismatch, had also been at Sandy's
that morning.

Amateur investigators have speculated that Cheri may have gone driving with
friends that evening, or may have eaten at a diner similar to Sandy's, thus
explaining how she managed not to be seen by anyone at the library.

The problem is, it doesn't explain how the friends haven't come forward, or how
the people at the restaurant didn't remember seeing her.  The ironic thing is,
her killer DID come forward with his own version of events, in The Confession
Letter.  So why wouldn't those who honestly wanted her murder solved come
forward as well?

It's because no one saw her.

If Cheri Bates had been out and about that evening, people would have reported
seeing her, just as they saw her in Sandy's that morning.  The most likely
explanation for no one reporting seeing her is that no one saw her.

The absence of witnesses who saw Cheri Bates that evening is all the more
striking when one realizes the notoriety of her murder and the dearth of
reports of her whereabouts.  People would not have been reluctant to volunteer
whatever they might have seen that night, when the police were asking on the
front page of the paper for witnesses to come forward with anything they had.

Cheri Bates was seen at church, she was seen at Sandy's, she was seen outside
the library that afternoon, and she was seen driving by a couple of witnesses,
the latter of whom didn't know who she was, but reported seeing someone who fit
her description in an alley about a block from RCC.

If no one reported seeing her after that incident, it's because they didn't see
her.

If they didn't see her, it's because she wasn't there.

Here's something else to think about:

When Cheri and her dad walked into Sandy's Restaurant that morning, they sat
down in a booth across from a woman who had already ordered food and was
waiting for her order.  Cheri and her dad placed their own orders, their
waitress came back with the food, Cheri and her dad ate, paid for their meal,
and left the restaurant all while the woman sitting across from them waited for
her own order to arrive.

Throughout that time while the woman waited for her order, which I assume was a
period of 20 minutes or so, Cheri Bates teased her about having to wait for her
food.  As far as I know, Cheri had never met the woman before, but Cheri Bates
was an extremely outgoing person and confident enough in her social skills that
she felt comfortable teasing someone she'd just met about her minor misfortune.

This is the same Cheri Bates who, if we are to believe the true crime
narratives offered by people like Robert Graysmith and Michael Butterfield,
walked into The RCC Library at approximately 6:20PM that Sunday evening, stayed
inside for 2 hours and 40 minutes, and then walked out as the library closed
circa 9PM . . . and didn't speak to a single person in all that time.  

RRIIVV--0033
At 10am, Joseph Bates left the house to spend the day at the beach.  The
standard timelines of that day don't elaborate on this raw fact, but if you
Google "Riverside Nearest Beach", you get, among other links:

Keep in mind that the information here is circa 2012 and not 1966, but we can
safely assume that the driving distances haven't changed too much.  Don't
laugh--traffic congestion in various large cities, including Los Angeles and
Houston, have significantly impacted travel times in and out of those cities in
the past 50 years or so.  In any case, the driving time to Newport Beach from
Riverside would have been roughly an hour, and to Huntington Beach about an
hour and ten minutes.

As far as I'm aware, no one has commented on the living arrangement of Joseph
Bates and his daughter in the 45+ years since her murder, despite the hundreds
of posts on Zodiac message boards in the past 14 years or so.

Joseph Bates leaves his house at 4195 Via San Jose at 10am that Sunday morning
to spend the day at the beach.  The drive to Newport Beach would take about an
hour, which means he would arrive there around 11am.  We also know that Joseph
arrived back at his house just after 5pm that evening, which means he'd have
left Newport around 4pm.

1111aamm--44ppmm  JJoosseepphh BBaatteess iiss aatt NNeewwppoorrtt BBeeaacchh

He may, of course, have gone to Huntington Beach instead.  In any case, we now
know that Joseph spent about two hours driving back and forth to the beach, and
he spent about five hours AT the beach.  Because it was the end of October, and
it started getting dark just after 6pm, we can speculate that Joseph left the
beach because the sun was starting to fade and in anticipation of the long
drive back to Riverside.

We can also speculate that he anticipated getting home in time to make dinner
for his daughter.  The division of labor in the household, according to
newspaper accounts, was that Joseph did the cooking and Cheri washed the
dishes.  If Joseph left the beach at 4pm in anticipation of an hour's drive,
which would then have him arriving home at 5pm, he may have intended to cook
dinner then.  But when he arrived home, he found Cheri's note taped to the
refrigerator door (further evidence that they may have tentatively agreed to
have dinner together when he got home around 5pm), and then went back out
himself, after taking a phone call from Cheri's friend Stephanie and leaving
his own note taped to the refrigerator door.

Cheri Bates and her father were close.  They lived together in a small house,
and Cheri's note to her dad, and the note he left for her on his brief return,
suggests strongly that they were in the habit of telling each other what they
were doing and where they were going.  I also suspect that, since they did live
in a small house, they also took care to give each other sufficient space to
breathe.  If Cheri planned on studying for her term paper that day, Joseph
might then take the opportunity to spend the day at the beach and be out of her
way.

Joseph's being out of the way might explain something else about Cheri's
movements that morning and afternoon.

RRIIVV--0044
What did Cheri Bates do between 10am, when her father left for the beach, and
3pm, when she called Stephanie?

We know Cheri made her initial call to her friend Stephanie at 3pm that
afternoon, so . . . what did she do between 10am and 3pm?  She wasn't seen
anywhere and she wasn't heard from for those five hours, so where was she and
what was she doing?  Most likely, she was inside her house.

That Cheri didn't discover that her bibliography was missing until she called
her friend Donna at 5:30pm strongly suggests that she probably didn't go
through her school paperwork at the house, and the absence of reports of other
phone calls suggests that she didn't call anyone.

Maybe she did housework?  We know that, in addition to her school work, Cheri
had two part-time jobs, one as a clerk/typist at RCC, and the other as a teller
at a local bank, plus she was a cheerleader for RCC, so she would not have had
a lot of time to do cleaning and laundry at her house.  In addition, we know
she'd spent the previous weekend in San Francisco seeing her fiance and meeting
his parents.  So the most logical assumption we can make is that she spent
those five hours, between 10am and 3pm, putzing around the house cleaning and
doing other chores, and this is probably what she told her dad she was going to
do while he spent the day at the beach.

It's entirely possible that her dad suggested at some point that she go to
Newport Beach with him, and that Cheri declined because this was her chance to
catch up on work around the house.

I would suggest that the movements of both Joseph Bates that morning and Cheri
Bates late that afternoon are consistent with the desire to stay out of each
other's way, and shows the level of sensitivity that one would expect of a
father and daughter who were very close.  Joseph goes to the beach so he's not
in Cheri's way as she does housework, OR Cheri opts to stay at the house to
catch up on housework while her dad (who is, after all, single) has fun at the
beach.  Cheri decides to work on her term paper that evening at The RCC
Library, so when her dad comes home he can watch TV if he wants, and she does
housework during the day when she's alone so doing it later doesn't disturb
him.  If you're sharing a small house with someone, you want to do the
vacuuming when the other person is out, if possible.

Joseph Bates had a background in the defense industry; he was a skilled
technician, and his daughter was an honor student who was intelligent,
outgoing, and clearly responsible.  Her employment record speaks to her
trustworthiness.  One would expect their living arrangements and time
management to be orderly and well thought-out, and that's the impression their
movements on that day give us.

RRIIVV--0055
What did Cheri Bates do between 3pm, the time of her initial call to her friend
Stephanie, and 3:45pm, when she called her back?

Before we consider that question, lets backtrack for just a moment.

Remember what I said at the beginning of this chapter?

"Every time I look at conventional aspects of the Zodiac murders, I eventually
come to the conclusion that I haven't looked closely enough at what's there,
and I decide to go back and UP the magnification.

For the past 14 years, message board posters have looked at the raw facts of
the Zodiac investigation and speculated randomly about this or that detail. The
best conversations along these lines were to be found on Tom Voigts original
archived message board, which is a reflection of the all-star lineup to be
found there (though the very best Zodiac researcher, Ray Grant, chose NOT to
post there for reasons of his own).

But even Toms original board failed to take a systematic approach to the
timeline. They tended, instead, to focus on a particular aspect of the murders,
such as what specific weapon the Zodiac might have used at Lake Herman Road. My
own speculations about the contents of Cheri Batess stomach were prompted by a

I bring this up because it demonstrates how even a very valuable insight can be
lost when theres no context to put it in. William Baker was, of course, wrong
about the circumstances. What SEEMED to be known about the time line of Cheri
Batess murder back in 2003 (the narrative put forth in The Confession Letter,
for example) turns out to be impossible; things could not possibly have
happened that way. Therefore, the undigested food found in the victims stomach
is EXTREMELY significant.

Mind you, the stomach contents dont stand alone in my analysis; they simply
back up what Im saying elsewhere.

And what Im saying, for the most part, is that CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING.

If I appear to be doing micro-analysis at times where it isnt called for,
thats why.

I want, in constructing this timeline, to nail down everything that can be
nailed down. Because if I dont, dedicated Zodiac researchers will pick up what
ISNT nailed down and run with it.

Maybe. Except she had roast beef and vegetables for supper back at her house
between 4pm and 5pm that afternoon. So we have to assume that the roast beef
and vegetables found in her stomach during her autopsy was the same roast beef
and vegetables she ate at her house before 5pm . . . in the absence of evidence
to the contrary.

And there IS no evidence to the contrary. No one at any eating establishment
reported seeing Cheri Bates that evening (even though people at Sandys
Restaurant that morning remembered seeing her and even remembered what she
did), and everything Cheri said to anyone (Stephanie, Donna, her dad) indicated
her intention to spend the evening at the library.

It is my contention that, in pursuing this course of connecting the dots of
Cheri Batess last day, and NOT being content with just regurgitating the raw
facts without processing them, we will not only arrive at the truth, but also
avoid most of the more obvious false steps.

So . . . what did Cheri Bates do between that first call to her friend
Stephanie at 3pm and the second call at 3:45pm?

The logical answer is that she put the phone down, made a mental note to call
again in 45 minutes, and then began preliminary preparations for going to the
library, perhaps by taking a shower (after having spent five hours doing
housework), changing clothes, and putting on makeup.

Remember, Cheri likely did NOT go through her course paperwork, since she
didnt discover that the term paper bibliography was missing until 5:30pm, when
she called Donna on the phone. And she probably did NOT go back to doing
housework, since calling Stephanie would likely have been something shed do
AFTER finishing her housework, and would represent a transition toward spending
the evening working on her term paper. People like Cheri Bates, who have many
ongoing activities in their lives (school, cheerleading, two part-time jobs, a
fiancé in San Francisco, and keeping house with her dad) are able to do all
those things by focusing on one task at a time.

So the most likely answer to the question is that Cheri began preparations for
the evening ahead by showering/changing clothes/putting on makeup, or other
transitional tasks, and that those activities were "bookended" by the phone
calls at 3pm and 3:45pm.

RRIIVV--0066
Cheri Bates called her friend Stephanie at 3:45pm and asked if she wanted to go
to the library with her that afternoon. Stephanie declined.

Just to quickly deal with a possible objection: obviously, theres no way of
knowing that Cheri Bates didnt just sit down at her kitchen table that Sunday
morning, and spend the next five hours reading the Sunday paper. She may have
done just that. Were constructing a timeline of likely events here, not trying
to establish facts that are inherently unknowable. We will never know EXACTLY
what Cheri Bates did the last day of her life. If I say that doing housework
for five hours was a likely activity for her, considering the circumstances of
her life at that point, Im making a choice. Much of what happened to Cheri
Bates that day CAN be established with reasonable certainty. The five hour gap
between 10am and 3pm is the longest period of uncertainty within that day, but
even there we can make assumptions about what Cheri most likely did, especially
since we know what she probably DIDNT do (for example, she probably DIDNT
look at her course paperwork, since her bibliography was missing and she didnt
mention that to Stephanie).

A further advantage in establishing likely activities during gaps is that it
helps fill in the picture of that day; what she did prior to leaving the house
bears witness to her movements away from the house and vice-versa. If we can
establish likely activities during the times when she was alone, they may
better explain the glimpses we catch of her later on. Conversely, if we dont
make some reasonable assumptions about what she was doing earlier, we may make
all sorts of UNlikely suppositions about what happened later (such as that she
went to a diner at some point, which doesnt make sense given what she said to
her friends and her father).

Lets quickly review that day as we have it so far:

Cheri must have known that The RCC Library closed for a supper break between
5pm and 6pm. So if she called Stephanie initially around 3pm, that suggests the
possibility that she wanted to, or was at least open to, getting herself to the
library PRIOR to its closing. Since the drive to the library was 10-15 minutes,
that might have given Cheri something like an hour and a half at the library
that afternoon:

As I said, this would give Cheri about an hour-and-a-half at the library that
afternoon, as opposed to the 2 hours and 40 minutes she would have had if shed
arrived at the library that evening.

Granted, an hour-and-a-half is probably stretching it, but the possibility of
her driving to the library earlier illustrates two things: 1, Cheri, who was an
extremely social person, wanted to go to the library WITH Stephanie if
possiblethis further underscores how unlikely it was that Cheri could be in
The RCC Library for 2 hours and 40 minutes that night without talking to
anyone; and 2, Cheri wanted to get back home shortly after 5pm so she could
have dinner with her dad.

It seems unlikely that her dad would have gone to the beach that day without
suggesting to Cheri when he would probably come homearound 5pm or so. It seems
reasonable to assume that Cheri would thus be prepared to spend just over an
hour at the library with her friend that afternoon and then drive home in time
to have supper with her father. Thats the sort of person Cheri was, and that
still left open the possibility of her returning to the library that evening
after having dinner with her dad.

But when Cheri finally made the connection with Stephanie, it was already 3:
45pm, which, even if she had showered, changed clothes, and gotten ready to
leave in between the calls, would have left her less than an hour to spend at
the library after she drove there.

And Stephanie declined the invitation.

So when Cheri put the phone down, shed have considered TWO possibilities:

Im citing a detail here from the Inside Detective Magazine edition of January
1969, but the article contains at least one glaring inconsistency. On page 5,
it has the Mexican-American student seeing Cheri Bates outside the library at
5:30pm; on page 7, it has Cheri Bates, or someone dressed just like her,
arriving outside the library at 5:40pm and then going inside at 6pm and
charging out the books found inside her car. As I will demonstrate when I get
to that point, Cheri Bates could not possibly have charged books out at 6pm
that evening, unless were willing to throw out two witnesses who saw her
driving TOWARD the library after 6pm, and also question the account of the
Mexican-American student who saw her at 5:30pm.

I think it much more likely that Riverside PD could simply not account for
Cheri Batess whereabouts after 6:15pm that night, and therefore assumed that,
since charged-out books were found on the front seat of her car, she must have
hurried inside when the library reopened at 6pm and charged the books out at
that time, and then immediately left the library. Thus the wording on page 7:
It has been determined that . . .

The 5:40pm-6pm timeline had been determined by police because, as far as
Riverside PD was concerned, they had eliminated every other possibility;
unfortunately, THAT possibility is also impossible . . . as we shall see
momentarily.

Apparently Joseph Bates returned home shortly after 5pm that evening and found
dishes in the sink and/or leftovers in the refrigerator. The Inside Detective
article cites Riverside Police Department personnel as its primary source,
thus, we can assume this is information they got from Cheris dad.

The only bit of information we have that might be in conflict with this
supposition is the note Cheri left taped to the refrigerator prior to leaving
the house: DADWENT TO RCC LIBRARY.

The note makes no mention of her having prepared supper; perhaps that was
simply self-evident, and its possible that Cheri had already told her dad that
morning that she would probably cook supper herself. That she felt she had to
leave the note suggests that she DIDNT tell her dad that morning that she was
going to the library that evening. Or perhaps she did mention it as a
possibility, and the note was simply confirmation of where she was headed.

But wouldnt cooking dinner herself have represented a break from what her dad
would expect, since the division of labor in the household was that Joseph
cooked and Cheri washed dishes?

In considering questions such as this, I have a considerable advantage over
other Zodiac researchers, most of whom are a generation or so younger than I am
and were very young children when the Zodiac crimes took place. Why, Mike
Butterfield wasnt even conceived yet when Cheri Bates was murdered! Yet
another aspect of the crime that leads us to reflect, If only we could go back
and somehow prevent some things from happening . . .

Cheri Bates was born on February 4, 1948; I was born on April 29, 1951. She
died when she was 18 ½ and I was 15 ½.

In 1966, there were no microwaves, no induction cooktops, no Jet Stream ovens.

If you wanted to have roast beef and vegetables for supper, the cooking time
was a bit longer than it might be today. For starters, most supermarkets
werent open on Sunday in 1966, so chances are both the roast beef and
vegetables were frozen prior to preparation. We can assume that Cheri had the
foresight to start thawing the meat earlier in the day, and even in 1966 making
vegetables would have come down to taking a small rectangular package out of
the freezer, putting the contents in a pot with a lid on, and heating for 10
minutes or so, but the meat would have taken longer.

She would have put the roast in the oven just after talking to Stephanie, and
assuming average cooking times in a conventional oven, could have expected to
have supper ready by 4:30pm or so. If she doesnt start making supper around
4pm, and instead waits for her dad to come home sometime after 5pm, which would
probably have been closer to their usual supper time, now shes very likely
cutting into her study time that evening, since its unlikely her dad could
cook dinner and give Cheri time to get to the library by the time it reopened
at 6pm. Someone as organized as Cheri Bates would probably not want to wait
that long to get to the library; she would likely have preferred to have a
chunk of time to work on her term paper.

If Cheri Bates cooked roast beef between 4pm and 4:30pm that Sunday, there
would have been leftovers in the fridge, assuming she didnt eat an entire
roast herself for supper. In 1966, people typically would cook a roast in the
oven and then, if the entire roast wasnt consumed by a family at suppertime,
the remains of the roast would be put in a container and either eaten as
leftovers or possibly used for sandwiches.

One last possibility along these lines is that what Cheri cooked on Sunday
afternoon was already leftovers that shed taken from a container in the
refrigerator. Just going by my own experience, people in 1966 would be more
likely to have roast beef for Sunday supper; Saturday night fare for the middle
class in the 1960s would be hot dogs or something less of a sit-down dinner
meal. Keep in mind that Catholics like Cheri and myself would always have fish
on Fridaysin my house it was usually fish sticks with spaghetti, and on
Saturdays wed have hot dogs and beans.

In any case, Cheri Bates had roast beef and vegetables for supper, which she
ate between 4:30pm-5pm. Whether this was apparent to Joseph because Cheri left
the dishes in the sink, or because she left a container full of leftovers in
the fridge, or both, is secondary.

Since we know Joseph Bates returned home just after 5pm, which was just after
Cheri left, and since we know he read the note taped to the refrigerator, took
a call from Stephanie, and then left a note of his own (probably also taped to
the refrigerator) and then went back out again . . . we can assume Joseph Bates
was back inside the house about 10-15 minutes, if that.

Weve gotten ahead of ourselves here. Lets go back and connect the dots of the
timeline.

RRVV--0077
Cheri Bates cooked roast beef and vegetables for herself between 4pm and 4:
30pm.

RRVV--0099
Cheri Bates ate the roast beef and vegetables shed prepared between 4:30pm and
5pm.

If youre paying attention, you will notice that theres a gap between those
two items!

Heres what belongs in the gap:

RRVV--0088
Friends of Cheri Bates walked by her house at 4:30pm and noticed her car parked
outside.

At about 4:30pm that afternoon, friends of Cheri Bates walked past her house
and noticed that her lime green VW Beetle was parked outside. This sighting
both underscores Cheri's popularity and her visibility. People LIKED Cheri
Bates, but more important for our examination of her last day, they NOTICED her
and things about her, such as her car being parked outside her house that
afternoon.

Does everyone see the dichotomy here?

Cheri Bates goes to church that morning and has breakfast in Sandys
Restaurant. People from the restaurant recall her being there that morning and
teasing the woman who was waiting for her order. Then she goes home and is by
herself inside her house for the next 7 hours . . . and people walking by are
STILL aware of her presence though no one actually sees her.

BUT . . . the Graysmith/Butterfield timeline of Cheris last day has her
walking into The RCC Library circa 6:20pm and not being noticed by anyone for 2
hours and 40 minutes, followed by another 1 hour and 30 minutes outside in
front of the library. After 6:15pm that night, Cheri Bates was not seen or
heard from by anyone, and did not speak to anyone for 4 hours and 15 minutes
until the time of her murder at 10:30pm.

Maybe there are murder victims who were out and about under their own power for
4+ hours prior to their murders who managed to remain silent and unnoticed
during that entire time, despite being in the physical midst of dozens of
potential witnesses.

Cheri Bates is not one of those victims.

The Cheri Bates that her friends and acquaintances knew and experienced, even
on that last day of her life, would NOT have remained silent and unnoticed for
4+ hours. It is simply not possible.

At the risk of being accused of beating a dead horse, let me review our
progress to this point:

This tells us that Cheri had a personal schedule; her life was planned and
thought-out in advance.

Cheri teased a fellow diner because she hadn't received her order; Cheri Bates
was playful and outgoing.

Again, this is consistent with two people living in a small house keeping out
of each other's way.

Cheri's weekdays would have been busy, and Saturday would have been the logical
time for things like cheerleading practice or working at the bank in the
morning.  When I was a student in parochial school, we traveled to St. Mary's
Seminary once a year, in the fall, and I was surprised to find out from one of
the students that the "weekend" at St. Mary's was actually Thursday/Sunday, NOT
Saturday/Sunday, because splitting the "off" days broke up the week more. 
Cheri Bates had a full class schedule, two part-time jobs, cheerleading, and a
fiance she had just visited the previous weekend.  It's reasonable to assume
she would use that Saturday to take it easy and relax, and schedule things like
housework and her term paper for Sunday.

Again, the logical sequence would be: a), her dad leaves for the beach; b), she
does laundry, vacuuming, cleaning, and other housework between 10am and 3pm,
and, having finished those chores, c), she calls Stephanie at 3pm.  Not getting
an answer, she showers, changes clothes, and puts on makeup if she's wearing
any that evening.

Cheri clearly chose to prepare and eat supper and then spend the evening at the
library.

This puts Cheri in her house at 4:30pm.  Since we know that Cheri was out and
about under her own power up until 6:15pm, the presence of her car outside her
house means she was inside her house at 4:30pm.

This means that Cheri left her house sometime between 4:30pm, when her friends
saw her car, and 5pm, when her dad returned home from the beach.

SSuunnddaayy..

We have to assume that Cheri Bates left her house more toward 5pm than 4:30pm,
for several reasons:

a), if she cooked and ate supper between 4pm and 5pm, we would expect that to
take a bit longer in 1966 than it might today, thus more toward 5pm;

b), if she had left the house just after 4:30pm, she would have arrived at The
RCC Library before 5pm, since the driving time between her house and The RCC
Library was 10-15 minutes.  The timeline would look like this:

Granted, Cheri would not have had much time to do anything in the library in
the scant minutes before it closed for supper at 5pm.  However, two things
WOULD have been possible:

1, Someone would see her; and

2, She could--very hastily, I'll admit--charge books out.

Well, we know that no one saw her at the library before it closed at 5pm.

Police have insisted that Cheri Bates must have charged out books that evening,
which is to say, after it reopened at 6pm.

If the library used an "evening" card to charge out Cheri's books, this would
lead Riverside PD to the conclusion it made.

In 1966, most libraries used a system where a card identifying the book, a card
identifying the person borrowing it, and a card identifying the date (and
possibly the time in general terms--RCC may have used a MORNING, AFTERNOON, and
EVENING card with the specific date) were all photographed together.  A
librarian charging out a stack of books would only need to change the card
identifying the book for each charge-out record to be made.

Riverside PD has never suggested that Cheri Bates might have charged out books
before 5pm.

Therefore, we should probably assume that the books found on the front seat of
her car were charged-out with a card indicating it was done during the EVENING
session.

It is, of course, conceivable that Cheri arrived just prior to the library
closing, which would have corresponded to leaving the house circa 4:45pm or
so.  This seems unlikely.  The library entrance figured to be most crowded at
5pm, thus Cheri Bates would most likely be seen by other people around that
time, if she was waiting outside the building.  But she wasn't seen by anyone
at 5pm.

I suspect the area outside the library was relatively deserted by 5:10pm or so,
and Cheri Bates wasn't seen outside the library until 5:30pm, so the most
likely time for her to have left her house would have been just prior to 5pm.

In other words, Cheri Bates and her father just missed each other at the house,
probably by 5-10 minutes.  I suspect that Cheri left her house circa 4:55pm-
5pm, and her father arrived home circa 5:05pm-5:10pm.

At just after 5pm that evening, Cheri Bates is driving toward The RCC Library
for the first time that day.

Joseph Bates is driving toward their house and is within just a few minutes of
reaching it.

The RCC Library has closed for the supper break between 5pm and 6pm.

Cheri Bates has an hour and fifteen minutes of freedom left to her.  If eyes
are watching her, prepared to make a move, Cheri is, at the moment, too
distracted to notice them.


RRVV--1100
At just after 5pm that evening, Cheri Bates is driving toward The RCC Library
for the first time that day.

I'm writing this on the morning of Thursday, August 16, 2012.  Since Mike
Kelleher has expressed curiosity, on ZodiacRevisited.com, as to where ZKT is
going, let's pretend we're in the passenger seat of Cheri Bates's lime green VW
as she drives toward The RCC Library that Sunday afternoon, just after 5pm, and
think about where this process is headed.

I am, to begin with, retracing my steps on that Sunday for at least the third
time, having not been satisfied with the level of detail I'd attained on my
first two trips through.  That's why I've had earlier timelines up on other
websites and taken them down.  I'll be re-posting that material shortly, but I
wanted to go back to the beginning and see if I'd missed anything on my first
couple of trips.

The typical thread on a Zodiac message board, and I'm talking about ALL of them
here--Tom's site, Mike's site, Morf's site--begins with citing some raw fact
from a Zodiac event and then various posters weighing in on what that angle
MIGHT mean.  If we go by when Tom's site originally went up on The Internet,
it's now been 14 years of beer & pretzel discussions resulting in absolutely NO
conclusions.

This is not the way to conduct an inquiry into ANYTHING, much less the most
notorious unsolved serial murder case of the 20th century.

I want the reader to participate in a brief experiment with me.

I want you to stand up in the middle of the room you're in right now.  You can
just read what I'm saying if you want to, and imagine what I tell you to do,
but you'll understand what I'm suggesting only if you actually get up and do
what I tell you to do.

Stand up in the middle of the room.  In front of you is North, to your right is
East, behind you is South, and to your left is West.  So go ahead and make a
quarter-turn to the right and face East.  Another quarter-turn, and face
South.  Another quarter-turn, and face West.  Now come back to face North.

The Chinese have a saying: A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a
single step.

Everything that happened to the Zodiac victims happened one moment at a time,
and everything began with where they were to begin with.  Whatever next
movement you make, in whatever direction, will begin with where you are now,
and that was true of Cheri Bates and all the other Zodiac victims.

It may be helpful to think of a timeline as a series of stepping stones in a
bubbling stream.  The best way to move between the stones is to first get your
footing securely on the stone under your feet.  Once you have a good feel for
where you are, you can move to the next stone with much greater confidence and
less fear that you'll end up in the water.

Zodiac message board posters insist on trying to think several steps ahead,
when they haven't established a logical sequence for the movements of the
victims, beginning with where they started.  More often than not, they
speculate about the victims without taking into account who the victims were. 
That's why most of their speculations are all wet.

Perhaps there are 18-year-old women in the world who could walk into a
community college library and not speak to anyone for 2 hours and 40 minutes,
and not be seen by anyone, and then stand out in front of the building for 1
hour and 30 minutes after it closed, and not be noticed by anyone.  I doubt it,
but perhaps there are teenagers who fade into the backdrop in the midst of
dozens of witnesses.

But if there are such young women, Cheri Bates would not have been one of them.

Cheri Bates could not spend 20 minutes in a diner that morning without being
noticed and causing a stir and interacting with a woman she didn't even know,
and being remembered by people and staff at the diner.

It is simply impossible to believe she could have been in the library that
night without people recalling her.

Cheri Bates ate roast beef and vegetables before leaving her house at 5pm. 
Four ounces of roast beef and vegetables were found in her stomach during the
same autopsy that estimated her death as having taken place at 10:30pm, which
coincided with earwitness reports of screams heard in the area.

5 hours and 30 minutes.

An 18-year-old cheerleader eats supper, then spends the evening doing research
at the library, and 5 hours and 30 minutes later, when she's murdered, still
has 4 ounces of that supper in her stomach.   

I'm 61 years old, having recently recovered from a long bout with gastritis,
and my digestive process is a lot faster than that.

Cheri Bates could not possibly still have food in her stomach when she was
murdered, unless something extremely intense happened to her to slow that
process down dramatically.

The lack of eyewitness accounts after Cheri was last seen at 6:15pm, and the
presence of food in her stomach many hours after it should have been empty,
tells us that Cheri must have been abducted.

If the account given in The Confession Letter were true, Cheri Bates should
have been seen and heard from by MANY witnesses both inside and outside the
library, leading up to the attack in the alley, and her stomach should have
been empty when she was autopsied.  Never mind that her car was left in a
condition Cheri Bates would never have left it in, if she'd been moving around
under her own power, and never mind that Cheri Bates would NEVER walk down a
pitch dark alley with anyone, much less a stranger.

I'm getting ahead of myself here.  I will return to the timeline sequence in a
moment, and we'll be sitting back in the passenger seat of Cheri's VW as it
pulls up outside The RCC Library between 5:10pm and 5:15pm that Sunday, and we
will move forward a moment at a time from there.

As Mike Kelleher has suggested recently, I am working out the details as I go
along.  At each point in the narrative, as I look around, new things are
occurring to me.  I will eventually post an article called RRiivveerrssiiddee TTiimmeelliinnee,
which will simplify the sequence.  I will then do an article called LLaakkee HHeerrmmaann
RRooaadd, and after I've analyzed what happened there, I will post an article
called LLaakkee HHeerrmmaann RRooaadd TTiimmeelliinnee, and so on.

In other words, I will attempt to explore every realistic possibility and then,
when I've determined which sequence makes the most sense to me, post an article
which connects those dots.

In other words, instead of just citing raw facts and speculating randomly, I
will process information, establish the most realistic narrative sequence based
on what the witnesses say and how the victims were known to behave, and . . .
drum roll . . . come to CONCLUSIONS.

These crimes took place more than 4 decades ago.

Are Zodiac websites EVER going to say, "This is what we think happened."?

Before I drop this train of thought and move on, I do want to cite the single
example of what I've been suggesting here, from the Zodiologists website.  By
the way, if anyone knows who specifically is behind that site, I'm curious to
know, since I'm plugging them here:

_Z_o_d_i_o_l_o_g_i_s_t_s_ _o_n_ _T_h_e_ _C_o_n_f_e_s_s_i_o_n_ _L_e_t_t_e_r

I don't endorse every aspect of their conclusion here, but I commend their
approach.  Bravo!

More to come momentarily.
