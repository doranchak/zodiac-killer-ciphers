In the movie IInncceeppttiioonn, Dom Cobb gives the student architect, Ariadne, a quiz.

He hands her a notebook with grid lines and times her. Her first maze is a
simple grid--too simple. His pen finds the exit in a few seconds. He rips out
the page and crumples it in one hand as he hands the notebook back. Her second
maze is more complex than the first, but not complex enough. He solves this one
just as quickly and shakes his head.

She yanks the notebook out of his hands, looks at the grid lines on the page,
turns it over to the blank side of the cover, and draws an oval labyrinth
without straight lines. His pen starts and stops and then hesitates as she
watches, faintly smirking. He finally stares down at the curved walls of the
third maze in wonderment.

The first maze I created was TTZZMMSS. It failed, at least in the sense that it
didnt convince everyone to remain inside the puzzle and follow it to the end.
And it was still very much under construction as they wandered through itmaybe
that was the problem?

The second maze was ZZKKFFII. Since it was more conventional, more people stayed
longer inside it. But they still ended up retracing their steps and exiting
back out the entrance.

ZZKKTT is the third maze.

Like IInncceeppttiioonn itself, this maze is multi-layered. It is a dream in which the
participants are aware theyre dreaming. But instead of opening our eyes at the
end of each episode, well descend still another level deeper . . .
