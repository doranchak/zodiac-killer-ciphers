Im going to do two official timelines: A . . . and B.

Timeline B will cover what I think actually happened in Riverside.

Timeline A will cover what clearly DIDNT happen.

In Errol Morris's non-fiction film, _T_h_e_ _T_h_i_n_ _B_l_u_e_ _L_i_n_e, the director uses
recreations similar to those found on True Crime TV shows (such as America's
Most Wanted) . . . but with one crucial difference.

Errol Morris believes David Harris killed Officer Robert Wood. But he never
shows us that. He shows us everything BUT that.

The reenactments in TThhee TThhiinn BBlluuee LLiinnee don't attempt to show the truth.

Instead, they illustrate lies.

They demonstrate things that DIDN'T happen.

COULDN'T have happened.

Couldn't POSSIBLY have happened.

My intent, on this website, is to establish, by examining the timeline of each
individual Zodiac murder, WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.

But, most of the time, I'll accomplish that by first showing what DIDN'T
happen.

What COULDN'T have happened.

What couldn't POSSIBLY have happened.

To paraphrase Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: Once one eliminates the IMPOSSIBLE,
whatever remains, however improbable, MUST BE THE TRUTH.

The truth in the Zodiac case is very hard to believe.

That's why I have to eliminate everything else first.

Cheri Bates attends mass at St. Catherine Church on Brockton with her father,
Joseph Bates. After mass, the two eat breakfast at Sandys Restaurant in The
Hardman Center, around the corner from their house. One acquaintance who sees
Cheri at Sandys that morning is Bob Barnett (not his real name), who will be
the chief suspect in her murder for almost 30 years.

TTIIMMEEOOUUTT:: 99aamm

If Im going to establish what DIDNT happen that Sunday, eliminating the chief
suspect in Cheris murder might be a good place to start.

Bob Barnett is the stuff of legendspecifically, URBAN legend.

If you made a pie chart of the alleged evidence against Barnett, the various
sections of the pie might read Unsubstantiated Stories, Jailhouse Snitch
Testimony, Things That Couldnt Possibly Have Happened, Witness Accounts That
Do Not Specifically Identify Barnett, Things That Are Patently Untrue,
Attributes Cheris Killer Shares With Barnett and Thousands of Others, etc..

Pie segments one could actually swallow?

Im still chewing on that one. Bob Barnett was a suspect because Riverside PD
needed a suspect, and theyd already eliminated everyone. So they went back and
took a fresh look at a non-suspect, with a little help from his friends.

Captain Roy Conway of Vallejo PD told me, in 1991 or 1992, that he couldnt
take my theory seriously because I believed the Zodiac killed Cheri Bates, and
Captain Conway knew Cheri Bates was killed by a local suspect. He couldnt tell
me why he believed this, but he did say that if I knew what he knew, Id agree
with him.

Thanks to Tom Voigt, I have since been able to look at Riverside PDs
circumstantial case against Bob Barnett. I will comment on each aspect of this
list in the order it was presented to me.

The single most important phrase in that paragraph is the first four words,
Initially cleared of suspicion. What this means, in the context of the Bates
investigation, is that Bob Barnett did NOT have scratches on his face and
person in the immediate aftermath of the murder, that his scalp was not bloody,
and that he was not otherwise marked in a manner that might suggest he had
grappled with Cheri Bates. It also means that his fingerprints did not match
what was left on and in Cheri Batess VW.

I want the reader to think about that for a moment.

For three decades, the chief suspect in the Cheri Bates murder was someone who
had already been excluded by forensic evidence taken from the crime scene.

Therefore, Bob Barnett could not possibly have murdered Cheri Bates . . .
unless you assume that more than one person was involved. If Barnett wasnt
scratched-up and his fingerprints didnt match the latents left at Cheris VW,
then he essentially stood by and let his accomplice do the dirty work for him.
His accomplice pulled the wire from the engine and left his greasy prints, his
accomplice got scratched-up in the struggle with the victim, and, as we found
out when the mitochondrial DNA stuck to Cheri Batess palm in blood was
compared with Bob Barnetts, his accomplice got his hair pulled out.

In the entire history of homicides, the Cheri Bates case is unique; a crime of
rage in which the enraged person sits out the murder with his arms folded.

Sorry, thats wrong. Riverside PD didnt have prime suspect earlier than
October 1969. Read Chief Kinkeads letter (October 20, 1969) to the Napa
Sheriffs Office, which was a follow-up to a phone conversation (October 17,
1969):

If Riverside PD honestly believed Bob Barnett or any other local suspect was
the killer, they would have mentioned that suspect, at least in passing, in the
letter. Instead, the chief points out the numerous similarities between the
Riverside murder and that at Lake Berryessa, and pushed for a comparison of the
latents from the Bates and Stine murders.

Polygraph exams arent admissible in court. Jailhouse snitches are notoriously
unreliable. Hearsay accounts featuring a single witness tend to be consistent,
since only the accused himself can contradict them.

Bob Barnett was in Cheri Batess class at Ramona High School and also attended
RCC. In a 2003 statement to Tom Voigt, Barnett insisted that he NEVER dated
Cheri, and in fact dated Cheris friend and co-worker at Riverside National
Bank, Donna. Since Barnett was the boy friend of one of Cheris best friends,
one of two women Cheri talked to on the phone on the last afternoon of her
life, it seems natural that he would be mentioned at some point in Cheris
diary. Riverside PD hasnt exactly been forthcoming about the contents of
Cheris diary, which tends to make me think what was written there doesnt back
up their version of the relationship. Granted, the contents of someones diary,
in relation to the guilt or innocence of a suspect, would be hearsay testimony,
but so is the rest of Riverside PDs case against Barnett.

Dennis Highland wasnt Cheris steady boyfriend; hed been her fiancé for two
years. Cheris trip to San Francisco coincided with that of his parents; I
dont know that they traveled together, but its clear that the four of them
intended to be together that weekend. Cheri could not possibly have informed
Barnett that she had accepted Highlands proposal that weekend, since she had
visited Highland in San Francisco that weekend WITH his parents. Barnett could
not have been dating Cheri Bates since he was dating Cheris girl friend,
Donna, and women are notoriously possessive about the guys theyre dating, even
among friends.

Let me just interject at this point, that if Riverside PDs version of these
events sounds completely ludicrous, thats because it is.

I mentioned The Urban Legend of Bob Barnett earlier; you wonder where stories
like this come from. Barnett has denied having any argument in public and has
denied slapping anyone. Nothing in the original reporting of the crime mentions
this incident or anything similar to it. If students at Riverside City College
had witnessed a very public argument between Cheri Bates and Bob Barnett, and
witnessed Barnett slapping her, and then, just days later, Bates was murdered .
. . wouldnt RCC have expelled him? The murder was the most notorious in the
history of Riverside, let alone RCC. If there was anything at all to the story,
wouldnt RCC have held some sort of hearing and been proactive about punishing
Barnett? By all accounts, Cheri Bates was one of the most popular students at
RCC; if she had been struck in public, wouldnt there have been an outcry to
deal with her assailant? And if that hadnt happened immediately, for whatever
reason, wouldnt there have been one days later, in the wake of her murder?

If Barnett was playing basketball, how could Cheri have called him? I was 15
years old in 1966, and take my word for it, we didnt have cell phones. Did he
have a basketball court inside his house? I remember Chicago Bulls superstar
Scottie Pippen being interviewed from the court which had been added onto his
mansion, but somehow I doubt Bob Barnett had a similar set-up.

Cheri could not logically have called Barnett after 6:15pm, since no one had
reported seeing or otherwise hearing from Cheri after she was sighted driving
up the alley by the March Air Force Base man a block from RCC at 6:15pm. If
Cheri had called Barnett after that time, Riverside PD would have been all over
that call. But no such call is mentioned in any of the news accounts after the
murder.

Cheri Bates and Bob Barnett werent romantically involved. Bob Barnett says it,
Dennis Highland has said it, and no one other than Riverside PD has suggested
it. The only logical reason I can think of for Cheri Bates to call Bob Barnett
that afternoon would have been in connection with looking for her missing term
paper bibliography. At approximately 5:30pm that afternoon, Cheri Bates called
her friend and co-worker at Riverside National Bank, Donna, and asked if shed
seen the bibliography laying around anywhere. Donna said she hadnt. Its
conceivable, though barely, that Donna brought up the possibility that Barnett
had seen the bibliography, since Barnett was Donnas boy friend and presumably
spent lots of time in her company. Cheri would ordinarily not have known
Barnetts phone number, but Donna could have given it to her under those
circumstances. Cheri might then have called Barnett to ask if hed seen the
bibliography; again, keep in mind that Barnett told Tom Voigt there was no ill
will between Cheri and himself.

Again, I dont see how Cheri could have called Barnett if he was already
playing basketball at an outside court or gymnasium. If Cheri called Barnett at
his house just prior to his leaving to play basketball with his buddies, he
might have been very exasperated at the request, and said something along the
lines of his quote above, something he wouldnt actually say to her face. Men
say things like that when they dont want to look like a wimp for doing a girl
friends friend a small favor.

Again, my point is, melodramatic as it sounds, the incident at, or more likely
prior to, the basketball game, may have been entirely innocent and not nearly
as menacing as it sounds. The only difficulty I see with the timeline is that
Cheri Bates almost certainly called Donna from a pay phone outside the library
at 5:30pm, which means she was already AT the library when she called, but
Barnett wouldnt have known that. Its also possible she called Barnett from
her house circa 6pm or so, after not being able to find the bibliography back
at her house, and told him shed be at The RCC Library that evening if he
managed to find it.

This sidebar is a bit convoluted, perhaps, but it demonstrates how critical it
is to place events in a timeline.

CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING.

9:30pm is a full half-hour AFTER the library closed. If The Confession Letter
is to be believed, Cheris killer waited INSIDE the library and then followed
her out after about two minutes. So how could he have been standing in the
alley at 9:30pm? And if Barnett was standing in the alley at 9:30pm, he
couldnt have been with Cheri Bates at her car, trying to get it to start.

Just to remind the reader, Bob Barnett is the prime suspect in the Cheri Bates
murder who was not scratched-up or otherwise marked when he was initially
interviewed, hadnt had his hair pulled out, and whose fingerprints did not
match those left at the victims car. None of the forensic evidence pointed to
him, he had no apparent motive, and he was not positively identified by the
only eyewitness in the area an hour prior to the attack.

But, since two men were seen in the general area of the crime scene at 1:30am
that morning, wielding flashlights, this leads Riverside PD to the conclusion
that Bob Barnett had an accomplice.

In police procedural terms, thats called Getting Two For The Price of NONE!

I hate to keep beating this dead horse, but polygraph exams are not admissible
in a court of law. Riverside PDs circumstantial case against Bob Barnett
consists almost entirely of hearsay testimony from extremely unreliable
witnesses, backed up by an assortment of polygraph results that prove
absolutely nothing.

The suggestion here is that Bob Barnett had murdered Cheri Bates and then
noticed, sometime later that night, that his Timex watch was missing. Again,
none of this makes any sense at all. The neighbors who said they saw two men
with flashlights in the area saw them circa 1:30am, not after 2:30am. If
Barnett had been searching for his Timex at 1:30am, why would he need a ride to
RCC an hour later? And how could two men spend 15 minutes at the crime scene
with flashlights and NOT find the Timex, which was ten feet from the body, a
black-banded watch laying on bright white gravel? We know they didnt find it
because the police did that morning. The watch face was also speckled with
white latex paint. Riverside PD would certainly have checked Barnett out for
any painting activity in the days prior to the murder.

Barnetts friends all sound like characters from a Martin Scorsese movie,
except for their willingness to cooperate with law enforcement. I suppose its
possible that Barnett was genuinely upset that morning to hear about Cheri
Batess death, and that his friend mistook his sorrow for remorse. In any case,
nothing ties Barnett to the crime scene.

This is about as vague as an investigative link gets. Police may have had shoe
prints, but they didnt have shoes. In any case, both the shoes and the Timex
watch were common items. If a vendor bought lots of surplus military items and
resold them, theres your link. The proximity of March Air Force Base led
police to suspect a military man may have committed the murder, just as they
suspected fellow RCC students.

Police initially eliminated Barnett because his face wasnt marked and his
fingerprints didnt match the latents. He also wasnt identified by any
witness, and had no motive until Riverside PD manufactured one for him.

The reader may well be asking the obvious question:

Why would Riverside PD have spend the better part of three decades pursuing a
suspect who had already been eliminated in the immediate aftermath of the
murder, and whose circumstantial case against him was so weak?

The answer goes back to that Kinkead memo of October 20, 1969.

_R_i_v_e_r_s_i_d_e_/_N_a_p_a_ _M_e_m_o

When the FBI lab checked the Riverside latents against what the Zodiac killer
left on Paul Stines cab in Presidio Heights, it concluded they were two
different sets of prints, from two separate suspects.

Here is Riverside PD Detective Steve Shumway in 2004, speaking once again with
Tom Voigt of ZodiacKiller.com:

""TThheerree aarree ttwwoo tthhiinnggss ffoorr ssuurree yyoouu ccaann sshhaarree wwiitthh yyoouurr mmaannyy rreeaaddeerrss:: TThheerree wwaass

Well, with all due respect, Detective Shumway, thats a conclusion not
supported by the evidence. What you actually mean to say is:

TThhee llaatteennttss lleefftt iinn PPrreessiiddiioo HHeeiigghhttss bbyy tthhee ZZooddiiaacc kkiilllleerr,, aanndd tthhee llaatteennttss

OOFF PPRRIINNTTSS..

Note that this is consistent with the actions of Riverside PD. Almost
immediately after the Kinkead letter to Napa, which suggested the comparison of
the latents on file at the FBI, Riverside PD did an abrupt about-face, dropped
its interest in any Zodiac link, and began pursuing Bob Barnett as a suspect.

If Cheri Bates was killed by one person, that eliminates the Zodiac. But, as
Ive already noted, Cheri Batess autopsy suggests strongly that she was killed
by TWO people. So if the Zodiac killed Cheri Bates . . . the Zodiac is at least
two people.

The one thing for sure I can share with my many readers, especially the Zodiac
website administrators and Zodiac message board posters who keep bringing his
name up as if he had ever been a viable suspect:

Bob Barnett was NOT involved in any way with the Cheri Bates homicide.

After 45+ years . . . GET OVER IT!
