Hey Dave,

Looks like I finally got your attention! Ill have to try that Gareth Penn
trick with other people. Maybe itll work on the Mayor of San Francisco? He
hasnt returned any of my calls so far.

Youve obviously been reading my websites, so I wont repeat what Ive said
already.

The point about Gareth was that he insists on putting up puzzles on his blog _G_Z
_4_2_1_6; the most interesting puzzle is why Gareth didnt bother to sue Michael
OHare for publicly holding him up to ridicule in _T_h_e_ _W_a_s_h_i_n_g_t_o_n_ _M_o_n_t_h_l_y
_a_r_t_i_c_l_e. I want you to imagine that youd spent almost 30 years of your life
accusing someone of being the most notorious uncaught serial killer since _J_a_c_k
_t_h_e_ _R_i_p_p_e_r. Then, one day, that person talks disparagingly about you in an op-
ed piece in a national magazine.

So you instantaneously file suit to get his fingerprints and _m_t_D_N_A, right?

Wrong!

_I_s_a_a_c_ _A_s_i_m_o_v once said that he didnt take much pleasure in the scores he got
on IQ tests, since he knew how stupid he was in so many areas such tests didnt
bother to measure. I feel the same way. Its pointless to make points about
Zodiac cryptography if people are ignoring larger issues that are staring them
in the face.

Look, The Cryptogram was a fairly easy multiple substitution cipher, which is
why I believe Mike Rodellis hypothesis that some agency (CIA, NSA, FBI, Mensa,
American Cryptogram Association) actually solved the puzzle within a few hours,
and then The Cryptogram was intentionally altered and put out to see if the
killer himself would be stupid enough to point out the discrepancies. This sort
of ruse where police put out an altered version of facts or events hoping that
a killer will come forward and correct them is ironically called a key. And
Donald Gene Harden was considered a suspect in the immediate aftermath of his
sending in the solution.

Except, of course, that that so-called solution tells us absolutely nothing. We
dont know anything more about the killer after The Cryptogram was solved
than we knew before . . . except for which symbols in his puzzle stood for
which letters.

Did you ever read _J_i_m_ _B_o_u_t_o_ns book, _B_a_l_l_ _F_o_u_r? At one point, he talks about
the patter ballplayers employ during pepper games. He quotes _F_r_a_n_k_ _C_r_o_s_e_t_t_i
exclaiming while fielding grounders, Hey, the old shillelagh! Bouton says
that the patter is true nonlanguage, specifically designed to say nothing.

Thats what I say about The Cryptograms solution, which is specifically
designed to distract the reader from its actual intent. The Zodiac is a master
of misdirection, and The Cryptogram is arguably the supreme example of it,
since he gets everyone to follow his buried treasure directions to what looks
like a dead end. And then, when they get there, they give up and walk away,
instead of asking themselves what it is theyve actually learned about the
Zodiac.

And the answer is: theyve learned which symbols stand for which letters.

And thats ALL theyve learned.

Dave, trust methats the lesson of The Cryptogram.

Now try applying that knowledge to The 340.

All the various brute force solutions youre suggesting on ZKF miss the point.

Since the physical copies of TZMS are where I spend the most time on the
cryptography of the case, and since I recently scanned the 1993 edition of my
book onto my TZMS website, Ill conclude with a cryptographic point.

Pages 275-276 of _T_Z_M_S_ _1_9_9_3_-_2:

Keep in mind that the entire Zodiac literature would consist of approximately
40,000 digits, maybe slightly more than that, if you converted every letter of
every message into Morse code (and then, both to allow conversions to binary
math and to make notation simpler, you used 1 for dash and 0 for dot).

Any particular 23-digit string showing up at random in a document of that
length should happen about once in 200 Zodiac literatures. For it to happen
twice, about once in 50,000 Zodiac literatures.

Those are long odds. Ive already pointed out the likelihood of EASTER in Morse
code showing up in the names of both Vallejo drivers. A killer would have to
terrorize 2500 lovers lanes to duplicate that coincidence. I tend to think the
cops would catch him before he could pull it off.

Of course, you try explaining that to a Zodiac message board poster, and he
just blinks at you.

Try this exercise, if you dont believe me. Convert a document the size of The
Confession Letter to Morse code, and then check it for the strings I found in
The Confession Letter, using the SEARCH function of your computer. Its a
fairly simple exercise for someone of your expertise. The strings are cited at
_T_Z_M_S_ _1_9_9_3_-_1, pages 118-125.

Let me tell you what youre going to discover for yourself. Youll type in a
given string, hit the SEARCH button . . . and nothing. Over and over and over
again.

Its because all the Zodiac documents contain undertexts, and non-Zodiac
documents (such as the 1978 letter) dont.

Thats the difference.

Mike Butterfield has mocked me in The Crackpot Files for saying, If you knew
more about the case, youd have a different opinion. Trust me.

When I said that to Tom DiMarco, it was the cryptographic undertexts I was
talking about. Thats how you know the Zodiac isnt _M_r_._ _M_a_g_o_o. But even if you
dont look at the documents, the conventional aspects of the crimes tell you
the same thing. As Michael Cole recently pointed out, the level of Premeditated
Situational Control is what gives it away. There was nothing random about what
he did.
