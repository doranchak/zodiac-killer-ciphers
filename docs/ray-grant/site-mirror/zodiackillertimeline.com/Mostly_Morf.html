The reason for my doing this should become clear as I do it.<br />
<br />
A quick word: Morf13 is a good guy.  About 3 years ago he got fed up with all the sniping in the Zodiac online community and decided to start up his own message board, with the help of AK Wilks, which would concentrate on discussing the case itself and dispense with all the personal stuff.  I&#8217;m not really a message board person, which is why I&#8217;ve chosen to respond to any points made by others on my own websites.  My experience in August 2011 of having 4-5 consecutive posts deleted by ZK.com moderators, mostly because they were &#8220;too long&#8221;, was pretty much the last straw, though granted I&#8217;ve posted a few times on Tom&#8217;s board in the year or so since.  Morf13&#8217;s main criticism of me has been that I tend to &#8220;hijack&#8221; threads, which may have some validity since people like The Foreigner and Tracers have said the same thing, but I had to laugh when I saw Morf13 posting lengthy comments on ZodiacRevisited.com articles, including one devoted to ZKT.  I guess whether you think you&#8217;re being hijacked or not depends entirely on which ultimate destination you had in mind.<br />
<br />
Here&#8217;s the initial comment he posted on Mike Kelleher&#8217;s article about my ZKT site:<br />
<br />
<b>morf13 August 15, 2012 at 12:12 pm <br />
Interestint possibilities that Ray Grant raises(I am certainly not endorsing any particular theory of his). I personally have attempted to reach out to 2 different people that knew Cheri, and got no responses from them . . . </b><br />
<br />
Morf13 posts under the Comments section of an article about my Riverside Timeline, he types exactly one vague sentence about that article, more than half of which is an emphatic renunciation of my work in general, and then abruptly launches into his own speculation about the Bates case which goes on and on in a very long post.  Would it be fair to call that a &#8220;hijacking&#8221; of the thread?<br />
<br />
Let&#8217;s take a look at slightly more recent comments on the same topic by Morf13.<br />
<br />
<b>morf13 August 19, 2012 at 8:46 am <br />
Despite the DNA results here ruling their suspect out as the source of the DNA from the Bates crime scene, Riverside PD REFUSES to let go of him as a suspect, and in my opinion, has stubbornly and recklessly jeopardized the chances of Cheri&#8217;s case ever being solved.</b><br />
<br />
Well, I am certainly not endorsing the actions of Riverside PD, vis-&#224;-vis the decision to make &#8220;Bob Barnett&#8221; the chief suspect after the fingerprints from Riverside and those from Presidio Heights were found not to match (see the October 20, 1969 memo to Napa SO by Chief Kinkead).<br />
<br />
But accusing Riverside PD of being stubborn and reckless and jeopardizing the chances of the Bates case ever being solved is one of those pot/kettle, glass house/stones, bramble/pomegranate tree situations.<br />
<br />
Morf, listen carefully: 65 witnesses inside and outside The RCC Library that night never saw Cheri Bates, her stomach contents tell us she was abducted earlier in the evening, the condition her car was left in tells us that she didn&#8217;t leave it that way voluntarily, the actions The Confession Letter claims she took are completely uncharacteristic of her, at least according to her friends and fiance, and the autopsy report of the wounds on her body tells us she couldn&#8217;t realistically have been assaulted by just one killer.<br />
<br />
And yet, the one major Zodiac website administrator who refuses to use his real name (as opposed to Mike Butterfield, Michael Cole, Howard Davis, Chris Farmer, Ray Grant, Tom Voigt,  and Chris Yarbrough) INSISTS upon speculating about what Cheri Bates did AFTER she walked out of the library and found her car wouldn&#8217;t start.  <br />
<br />
<b>In addition, they seem to want to distance themselves from and possibility of Zodiac being involved in her case, despite the fact that State writing expert and primary Zodiac document examiner, Sherwood Morrill, being of the opinion that Zodiac was indeed the writer of letters received in the Bates case.</b><br />
<br />
I&#8217;ve already listed the letters I believe were written by the Zodiac on the TZMS website.  Essentially, I believe all the Zodiac letters are authentic, including The Hole Card and The SLA Card, with the exception of The April 1978 Letter (which was almost certainly written by Dave Toschi), and including all three of the Riverside writings (The Desk Poem was not technically a letter, since it was never sent through the mail).<br />
<br />
But I&#8217;ll concede that handwriting analysis, and for that matter, document examination, appears to be an inexact science.  As I&#8217;ve said many times, and as can be seen in my analysis of Zodiac letters in TZMS 1993 (mostly on TZMS 1993-2), now posted on my TZMS website, the strongest reason to believe the Zodiac letters were all written by the same entity is that all of them contain a cryptographic undertext.<br />
<br />
If you put those three shared characteristics between the Riverside communications and The Bay Area Zodiac letters together: the general tone of the messages, the handwriting similarity, and the cryptographic undertexts, and add to them that the Zodiac acknowledged his &#8220;riverside activity&#8221; in a letter from March 1971, and that virtually no other killers had written to the newspapers prior to 1966, I really don&#8217;t understand why some people still believe Riverside wasn&#8217;t the Zodiac.<br />
<br />
Either Seagull or Tracers or Tahoe27 (I get those three mixed-up) put forth the opinion that The Confession Letter contained an attitude toward women in general that was much darker and more pathological than what was found in the Zodiac letters.  I won&#8217;t argue with that as an impression, but I question how much weight we can assign to it as categorically separating one letter writer from another.  I hate to keep harping on this, but I minored in Psych, and would have double-majored in English Writing and Psych if I&#8217;d taken the single-credit Psych labs attached to each course (six of them&#8212;I was 6 credits short of a major).  I had a significant amount of clinical experience as a student intern (though that term wasn&#8217;t commonly used back then), and I have to stress that all the psychologizing that you see on Zodiac message boards (particularly on ZKF, but you see it on all the Z boards) is just poking around in the dark.  You can&#8217;t make anything approaching a clinical diagnosis without having a subject to examine.  Period.  And it is generally a mistake to assume that real people are as consistent as either fictional characters or pathological prototypes.  If they were, there might not be any serial killers or mass murderers, because they&#8217;d stick out like sore thumbs while they were still in the developmental stage.  Preventing crime would be done along the lines of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Minority_Report">Minority Report</a>, except that the predictors would be psychologists instead of psychics.         <br />
<br />
<b>Furthermore,there ARE some files in the FBI reports that seem to indicate there was a comparison made between Bates case prints &amp; Zodiac case prints, BUT, there is no mention of the results which seems a bit curious. I wonder if there is a match that authorities are keeping to themselves.</b><br />
<br />
The opposite is true.  The behavior of Riverside PD, which was enthusiastic about the Zodiac link until after the comparison was made, tells us that the latents left on Cheri Bates&#8217;s car did NOT match the prints taken in Presidio Heights.  In other words, if the Zodiac killed Cheri Bates, then the Zodiac is at least two different people.<br />
<br />
<b>Also, there has been extensive discussions on various forums and sites, in which people have noted some common spelling errors,etc between the Bates &#8216;confession letter&#8217;, and Zodiac&#8217;s writing. Riverside felt that the details in the confession letter were known only by the killer, so in my mind, this doesnt do ANYTHING to rule Zodiac out as possibly being Cheri&#8217;s killer.</b><br />
<br />
As I stated, the circumstantial case connecting the Riverside writings to the Zodiac letters in The Bay Area is overwhelming.  It appears to be the same writer based on general characteristics (language, tone, handwriting, and the primary motive of publicity for his crimes).  There is also the absence of any alternative hypothesis: if, as Tom Voigt has suggested, The Confession Letter is a hoax, then it is an unusually elaborate hoax (two mailings, multiple carbon copies, a postmark 30 days after the murder) with no apparent follow-up.  The hoaxer made ONE phone call shortly after the murder, sent ONE very long and detailed typed letter a month later . . . and was never heard from again.  Most elaborate hoaxers keep writing&#8212;<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wearside_Jack">Wearside Jack</a>, the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peter_Sutcliffe">Yorkshire Ripper</a>&#8217;s doppelganger, sent three letters and a cassette tape and also made phone calls to the police.<br />
<br />
If there&#8217;s anything that absolutely jumps out at us about the Cheri Bates case, it&#8217;s that the police had no leads.  When one compares the amount of investigative legwork that was done, and how much manpower was used, with what the police actually went with&#8212;the &#8220;Bob Barnett&#8221; circumstantial case, which, in hindsight, was nonexistent&#8212;it tells us that they had ZERO local suspects.<br />
<br />
That doesn&#8217;t mean they didn&#8217;t check out everyone in proximity to the victim, like a stone dropped in a pond, starting with Cheri Bates and moving outward concentrically.  It means that, no matter how thorough their investigation was&#8212;and the library reenactment tells us Riverside PD&#8217;s due diligence was as exhaustive as any local investigation of a co-ed murder has ever been&#8212;they didn&#8217;t find anything.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates was killed by the Zodiac.  The only reason to doubt that was the FBI mismatch of fingerprints between Riverside and Presidio Heights, based on the assumption that either Cheri Bates or Paul Stine was killed by a single individual acting without an accomplice.  But the wounds cited in the Cheri Bates autopsy are consistent with at least two assailants working in tandem, unless one assumes that the victim fainted, fell to the ground, and then awakened in time to scream as her killer was cutting her throat.<br />
<br />
<b>Personally, I tend to think Cheri&#8217;s killer was likely around her age. The evidence suggests that she went off to a dimly lighted area for some time with her killer before she was attacked. I dont think she would have went off with a stranger, and I dont think she would have went off with a guy that was alot older then her. I think she felt at ease with and likely knew her killer, and didnt feel unsafe going with him, and this suggests a person that was around her age, possibly a fellow Ramona HS graduate or RCC student.</b><br />
<br />
Cheri Bates was 18 years old.  If her killer was her age, he&#8217;d have been 20 or 21 when the Zodiac events in The Bay Area took place.  21 is younger than any of the estimates of the Zodiac&#8217;s age.<br />
<br />
There&#8217;s no EVIDENCE suggesting Cheri Bates &#8220;went off to a dimly lighted area&#8221;.<br />
<br />
The eyewitnesses don&#8217;t place her either in the library or on the street.  Her stomach contents suggest she was abducted for several hours prior to her death.  The condition her car was left in argues against her leaving it that way voluntarily.  Both Cheri&#8217;s friends and her fiance have said she was terrified of the dark and would NEVER have walked down that alley voluntarily.<br />
<br />
Additionally, the walk from her car to that alley was 75 yards.  There were pay phones closer than that from which she could call friends to pick her up, or call her dad at the house of his friend, since she&#8217;d have known who he&#8217;d gone to the beach with.<br />
<br />
If Cheri Bates was killed by an individual, that individual would have had his face scratched-up and tufts of hair pulled out.  If the Timex watch was legitimately pulled off by the victim, that would have taken a significant amount of force, and we can thus be sure that an individual assailant would have been noticeably disheveled in the immediate aftermath of the murder.<br />
<br />
All the males in Cheri&#8217;s class at Ramona High School were checked out.  All her male classmates at RCC were checked out.  The police had visual inspection of face and hair to go by, fingerprints, and would have asked for alibis.  Additionally, all those so-called friends of Bob Barnett who tattled on him could have been checked for the mitochondrial DNA after Barnett was cleared: still no hits.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates was NOT killed by a local boy, Morf.  Tear that one up.<br />
<br />
Speaking of evidence, both the eyewitness accounts and the forensic facts argue very strongly that the Bates murder was premeditated, cold-blooded, and that the victim was NOT walking around under her own power just prior to her death.     <br />
<br />
<b>If you have read the Zodiac police reports for the Berryessa attack, you will know that surviving victim Bryan Hartnell described Zodiac&#8217;s voice as being likely in his 20&#8242;s, and Officer Slaight who took the call after the attack, described Zodiac&#8217;s voice as sounding &#8220;in his early 20&#8242;s&#8221;. Both Hartnell&#8217;s and Slaight&#8217;s descriptions of Zodiac&#8217;s voice, puts Zodiac in the same age group as people that Cheri would have known or associated with in Riverside back in 1966. I have looked one by one at every senior that graduated with Cheri from Ramona HS in 1966, and found one guy that moved to Napa in 1968 or so, and another who moved to Vallejo living on Webb St up until 1974(when the last Z letter was mailed), when he moved back down to Riverside. More information and research is required for these 2 men in my opinion.</b><br />
<br />
In my opinion those 2 have already been cleared.  If we start suspecting everyone who moved from Riverside to northern California, that&#8217;s a lot of suspects to process.  Any male Cheri would have associated with would have been looked at very closely (scratches, fingerprints, hair, alibi) and eliminated.<br />
<br />
Morf&#8217;s intent here is to suggest that some local boy that Cheri Bates felt comfortable with walked down a dark alley with her and then suddenly committed a very hot-blooded murder.  Eventually he moved to northern California and turned into the Zodiac.<br />
<br />
Well, that&#8217;s nice, but Morf believes this because he believes The Confession Letter.  Sometime in the past decade or two, Morf read The Confession Letter and became enamored with it.  He believed in it.  He took it to Vegas and married it in an Elvis chapel.  I hate to be the one to tell Morf this, but The Confession Letter has been unfaithful to him.  It&#8217;s no good.  It lied to him from the start. Someone should do to Morf like Cher did to Nicholas Cage in <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0x-fkSYDtUY">Moonstruck</a>.<br />
<br />
If you want to go on believing The Confession Letter, you&#8217;ve got to throw out everything else.  The several friends of Cheri Bates who were inside the library that night--you&#8217;ve got to ignore them when they say she wasn&#8217;t there.  All the library patrons who were parked on Terracina Drive, who walked to their cars without seeing a blonde having trouble with her car&#8212;pay no attention to those people.  Cheri Bates&#8217;s stomach, which magically stopped digesting the supper she ate before 5pm, beginning at roughly 6:20pm that evening&#8212;maybe it ran out of acid?  Cheri Bates&#8217;s car, which was unlocked with the windows rolled down and the keys in the ignition and her books and notepad left on the front seat, as if she&#8217;d suddenly had to leave it in that condition&#8212;she probably just decided, &#8220;To Hell with it!  I&#8217;ve got to go walk down a dark alley 75 yards from here!&#8221;<br />
<br />
Morf, whatever you do, don&#8217;t let go of that life raft, The Confession Letter; otherwise, you might drown in a sea of uncertainty.<br />
<br />
Plus, we KNOW the killer would never lie to us! <br />
<br />
<b>jeckyl August 22, 2012 at 10:48 am <br />
I agree with most of what you have to say regarding Cheri and if you are correct the trail begins with her murder. I have looked at Cheri graduating class but haven&#8217;t gone into your detail. It would seem her murderer was either a classmate or someone who lived in the neighborhood. I am interested in writing about Cheri as a person and not just as a murder victum, do you have any contacts that could give me some insight as to who Cheri was in real life. Additionally I would be interested in knowing who were the two classmates of Cheri&#8217;s that you mentioned.</b><br />
<br />
If you know anything at all about Cheri Bates as a person, you know she couldn&#8217;t have done what The Confession Letter says she did.<br />
<br />
But again: Don&#8217;t believe her friends or fiance&#8212;BELIEVE HER KILLER!!!<br />
<br />
<b>Zodiac Revisited August 22, 2012 at 9:08 pm <br />
I&#8217;ve always been troubled by RPD&#8217;s unwillingness to truly consider the possibility that the Zodiac was, in fact, the man who murdered Cheri Jo Bates. In my mind, there is an awful lot circumstantial evidence that ties the crimes of the Zodiac to the murder of Cheri Jo Bates. Personally, I feel that the &#8220;brush offs&#8221; line from &#8220;the confession&#8221; letter was partially symbolic and partially a red herring. I doubt that the killer actually knew Cheri Jo.<br />
That&#8217;s my $.02, FWIW&#8230;</b><br />
<br />
I agree with Michael Cole here.  As the Zodiologists website pointed out some time ago, why on Earth would a killer send the police a letter that points a finger in his own direction?  If the letter suggests that the killer had a hot-blooded motive for the murder, doesn&#8217;t that suggest we look in the opposite direction?<br />
<br />
John Douglas, in one of his books, mentions that anytime a killer seems to leave a clue intentionally for the police, his own instinct is to turn and look 180&#176; from where the murderer is pointing.  <br />
<br />
<b>morf13 August 23, 2012 at 4:21 am <br />
@ Jeckyl, the only people that would really know Cheri would have been her friends &amp; Family, and they are pretty tight lipped, I guess they don&#8217;t want to open old wounds.</b><br />
<br />
Cheri Bates&#8217;s character is pretty well-known, as attested to by friends, her fiance, and people who saw her fairly regularly such as the staff at Sandy&#8217;s Restaurant.<br />
<br />
The circumstances we&#8217;re dealing with here are not subtle.  Cheri was known to be terrified of the dark and to be leery of strangers, and yet we are told she walked willingly with guy who accosted her at her car, without first trying to phone her friends or her dad, who could have come and picked her up.<br />
<br />
<b>morf13 August 23, 2012 at 4:32 am <br />
@Mike Cole&#8230;I have to disagree with you on Cheri&#8217;s killer not knowing her. She apparently walked off with her killer into a dimly lit area, and it appears that she spent quite a bit of time with him over in the shadows before she was attacked. I just cant see an 18 year old college girl walking into a dark area with somebody she doesnt know, and spending time with him. I think she felt comfortable enough with him and knew him enough that she didnt think there was anything to worry about, and again because she was 18, and most 18 year olds wouldn&#8217;t be hanging out with older men, I tend to think that her killer was around her age, and likely a schoolmate, maybe her age or a year or two older.</b><br />
<br />
Morf is married to The Confession Letter account.<br />
<br />
The problem with being married to The Confession Letter is that you have to divorce yourself from reality first. <br />
<br />
<b>It truly is a shame that RPD has just written this off as no relation to the Zodiac case, they are completely ignoring Sherwood Morrill&#8217;s opinion that the Bates case letters were written by Zodiac. So how the police could simply turn a blind eye to that is rediculous.</b><br />
<br />
The police don&#8217;t believe in handwriting analysis.  Morf doesn&#8217;t believe in eyewitnesses, forensic facts, and character testimony about the victim.<br />
<br />
Again, RPD doesn&#8217;t buy the Zodiac link because the latents from Riverside don&#8217;t match those from Presidio Heights.<br />
<br />
<b>According to some sketchy details, I am pretty sure that RPD thinks that the reason their favorite suspect&#8217;s DNA didnt match the DNA from under Cheri&#8217;s nails, is because their POI had help when he killed Cheri, and that the DNA belongs to this 2nd man. I really dont believe there was a 2nd man that attacked Cheri, but RPD does.</b><br />
<br />
Morf, get your DNA straight.  The tissue under Cheri Bates&#8217;s fingernails was too decomposed to yield a DNA profile.  What RPD had was mitochondrial DNA, which meant the hairs stuck to Cheri&#8217;s palm in blood contained the root.  mtDNA is different from what is found in saliva, sweat, and semen.<br />
<br />
The wound pattern, as cited in the autopsy, is consistent with an attack by at least two assailants.  If the victim had not been restrained in some way during the assault, it&#8217;s difficult to imagine how she had superficial wounds to the torso, hands, and face, and deep slashes to the throat, particularly in a dark alley, and particularly in a situation where she was literally fighting for her life and had apparently torn off her killer&#8217;s wrist watch and pulled out his hair.<br />
<br />
Let me see if I can compare our two positions:<br />
<br />
Morf believes Cheri was killed by a local boy, in a sudden rage, a boy who later became the Zodiac.  None of the particulars of his viewpoint makes any sense, except for the Zodiac&#8217;s involvement.<br />
<br />
I believe Cheri was abducted circa 6:20pm that evening.  At least two people were involved in the abduction.  After she was led away, one of the abductors pulled the wire from the distributor, opened the door of her car, and leaned over onto the passenger seat, leaving a greasy palm print as he reached for her purse and student ID.  He then walked into the library and charged out books on her card to place her in the library.  He brought the books back to the car and left them on the front seat with her notepad.  He then walked away, not bothering to roll up the windows or take the keys out of the ignition.  It&#8217;s useless to speculate about Cheri&#8217;s abduction; she may have been driven elsewhere or may have been kept inside a van or other vehicle.  She was brought back to Terracina Drive circa 10:30pm or so, walked down the alley, probably at gunpoint, with the second assailant making sure not to walk too close to the other two so his footprints wouldn&#8217;t be associated with theirs.  The man in front of Cheri most likely held the gun; the man behind her had the knife.  When they reached the spot, the man in front grabbed her and held her while the man in back slit her throat from behind with several slashes.  The scratches to the face, hands, and torso were coincidental to this process.  My guess is the attack lasted just seconds and had been very carefully rehearsed by the two men.  Cheri had time to get her fingers in the way of some of the slashes, and managed to pull the hair of one of the men, and screamed very loudly.  Her second scream would have been muffled because of her wounds, and she would have lost consciousness very quickly.<br />
<br />
Once she was on the ground, one of the men pulled out the Timex watch and dropped it ten feet from the body.  The missing car was on Riverside, not Terracina, so it may have made more sense to them to make their immediate getaway on foot and then double back to the car.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m not sure about the two men spotted near the scene with flashlights at 1:30am.  It&#8217;s conceivable that someone had notified security at the college or police that a scream was heard, and that two plainclothes men came out and looked around.  What argues against this is that there&#8217;s no record of the incident in any of the police reports or newspaper articles, other than the witness account.<br />
<br />
What makes a lot less sense is that the killers would return to the scene of the crime because one of them was missing a wrist watch.  First, if you&#8217;ve got a flashlight, you&#8217;re going to find a black-banded watch on bright gravel that&#8217;s ten feet from the body in no time flat, especially if the beam from the flashlight is reflected back by the watch face.  Secondly, and I cannot stress this enough, a Timex watch in 1966 was as common an item as you might find; David Faraday had one on, as did Paul Stine, both with black bands.  All the speculation you read on Zodiac websites about that watch somehow identifying its owner (&#8220;Bob Barnett was known to have a watch just like that!&#8221;) is ludicrous.  This was before DNA profiling, so DNA from sweat on the watch couldn&#8217;t be gathered.  There was latex paint on the watch, but that wouldn&#8217;t have narrowed things down much.<br />
<br />
Most of the people who post on Zodiac killer message boards were either little kids or weren&#8217;t alive yet when Cheri Bates was killed.  No killer in his right mind would go back to the crime scene to retrieve a watch worn by most of the males in the general population in 1966.  And how likely is it that the killer wouldn&#8217;t have noticed his watch missing right away?  If you just murdered someone, and had planned the murder ahead of time, wouldn&#8217;t your first instinct be to check the time on your watch?  In 1966, very few cars had clocks on their dashboards.<br />
<br />
That Timex was not accidentally left behind; the killers left it there on purpose.        <br />
<br />
<b>In addition, I have an FBI memo that requested the FBI compare Bates case prints to Zodiac case prints, but I dont have any memo that shows the results. I wonder if the prints DID match, and police are keeping it a secret, or if they did not match, and that&#8217;s why RPD is so sure Zodiac wasnt involved in Cheri&#8217;s case. We might not ever know. In the meantime, the two individuals that graduated with Cheri, and then wound up living in Vallejo &amp; Napa during the Z murders, are of major interes to me.</b><br />
<br />
Morf, you don&#8217;t need a second memo.  The behavior of RPD tells you the prints didn&#8217;t match.  They were enthusiastic about the Zodiac link in the original memo, and they started their investigation of Bob Barnett in earnest afterward, and they remain adamant that the Zodiac did not kill Bates.  I don&#8217;t need Riverside PD to tell me what happened with the latent comparison; I can figure it out.<br />
<br />
<b>Another point that contributes to my belief in this area is the sophistication of the ruse. This is a significant instance of something I call &#8220;Premeditated Situational Control.&#8221; It&#8217;s very similar to the manipulation in the cases of Lake Berryessa and Kathleen Johns (both of which were, undoubtedly, strangers). If Cheri Jo had known her assailant, there is a strong probability that he would have chosen a different approach. The ruse in question was specifically designed to create trust in an unsuspecting victim and, IMO, was required because she was a stranger.  That&#8217;s my take. Hopefully, someday, we&#8217;ll know for certain what the situation actually was&#8230;</b><br />
<br />
Michael Cole makes a compelling point here; I was so focused on the Bates murder that I didn&#8217;t see it for myself.  Although, as Pierre Bidou pointed out, the modus operandi of the murders was technically different each time out, there is strong evidence that the Zodiac thought out his attacks in meticulous detail.<br />
<br />
If the reader will review my version of the Cheri Bates murder above, and then consider how similar the overall approach was to what happened at Lake Berryessa, and in the Kathleen Johns incident, this Premeditated Situational Control that Mike talks about becomes evident.  For that matter, what happened in Presidio Heights, where, as Armstrong points out in the movie, the killer waits for the driver to put the cab in PARK before shooting him, and then gets into the front seat and cuts off part of Paul Stine&#8217;s shirt so he can send pieces of it with his letters, shows that the level of premeditation went beyond situational control.  He wasn&#8217;t just trying to control his victims; he was trying to control the entirety of the event, including how that event was perceived afterward.<br />
