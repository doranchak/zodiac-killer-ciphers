<br />
I myself believe that The Confession Letter was written by Cheri's killer, but I think the distributor wire is less significant than the writer's reference to the knife he used to commit the murder.</font>
<font style="font-size: 18px;"><br />
<br />
Here's the critical passage from The Confession Letter:</font>
<font style="font-size: 18px;"><br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><b>I PLUNGED THE KNIFE INTO HER AND IT<br />
BROKE.&nbsp; I THEN FINISHED THE JOB BY CUTTING HER THROAT. </b></font></font></font></font><br />
<br />
Since we've just looked at the autopsy in detail, here's the obvious question:<br />
<br />
Is there evidence anywhere in that autopsy that the killer broke his knife off into the victim?<br />
<br />
If there is, maybe the reader can point it out to me.&nbsp; I didn't see it, and I literally retyped the entire autopsy report.<br />
<br />
When a medical examiner finds a wound on a body, he normally probes that wound, either with an instrument or with the tips of his fingers.&nbsp; This is done even when the autopsy being performed is that of a dead President, as happened at Bethesda Naval Hospital in November 1963.&nbsp; Once the surface of the body is examined, the autopsy surgeon then opens up the torso to examine the internal organs, as we saw in the Cheri Bates autopsy report.<br />
<br />
No broken-off blade from the killer's knife was noted anywhere on or in her body.<br />
<br />
However, it's possible that the broken-off blade fell back out of the body, isn't it?<br />
<br />
<b>The dirt in a radius of 12 feet around the body was hand sifted to a depth of three inches, but the search uncovered only two coins and other small debris.</b><br />
<br />
Another way of saying this is that no broken-off blade was found by the autopsy surgeon, and no broken-off blade was found by any of the crime scene technicians.<br />
<br />
I suppose it's possible that the killer inadvertently kicked the broken-off blade after it fell out of the victim's body, or that the broken-off blade ricocheted out of her body so violently that it fell to earth outside that 12-foot radius . . . but if that's true, then the writer of The Confession Letter killed the victim after all, right?<br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 18px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><b>I PLUNGED THE KNIFE INTO HER AND IT<br />
BROKE.&nbsp; I THEN FINISHED THE JOB BY CUTTING HER THROAT.</b><br />
<br />
If the writer of The Confession Letter was telling the truth, there should have been some evidence of his knife having broken when he stabbed the victim . . . and there wasn't.&nbsp; There was a single laceration of the 5th rib, a bone which might be hard enough to break the knife, but no fracture of the rib and no sign of the broken blade. <br />
<br />
So why would he say that the knife broke?<br />
<br />
The autopsy, taken at face value, tells us that the killer never stabbed the victim.&nbsp; The wounds to the face are incidental to the throat slashes, the wounds to the fingers are defensive, and the wounds to the throat are mortal.<br />
<br />
That leaves the wounds to the torso, all of which were superficial, none of which was remotely life-threatening.<br />
<br />
It's a knife attack, a crime of rage, in which the victim was never stabbed.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates was murdered 45+ years ago, and yet, no one has questioned her killer's method.<br />
<br />
The reason for that may be found in that single sentence:<br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 18px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><b>I PLUNGED THE KNIFE INTO HER AND IT BROKE.</b></font></font></font></font><br />
<br />
If there's one thing the killer DIDN'T do, it's plunge his knife into the victim.<br />
<br />
But SAYING that he did has distracted people from looking at what actually happened.<br />
<br />
Note that the killer writes that the knife broke, and THEN he cut her throat:<br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 18px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><b>I PLUNGED THE KNIFE INTO HER AND IT<br />
BROKE.&nbsp; I THEN FINISHED THE JOB BY CUTTING HER THROAT.</b></font></font></font></font><br />
<br />
In other words, he was prevented from stabbing the victim because his knife broke, so his only alternative was to cut the victim's throat ear-to-ear with a more shallow stroke of his broken blade.<br />
<br />
Again, there's no physical evidence that the killer's knife broke.&nbsp; In addition, it's hard to imagine how a killer caught up in his own rage, stabbing a victim in a pitch dark alley, could be aware that his knife had broken.&nbsp; There were only a handful of slashes to the torso, and the cuts on the hands and face were collateral, so how could the killer have known, in total darkness, that his knife blade had broken?&nbsp; And how could he act so quickly to suddenly concentrate on the throat area?<br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 18px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><b>I PLUNGED THE KNIFE INTO HER AND IT<br />
BROKE.&nbsp; I THEN FINISHED THE JOB BY CUTTING HER THROAT.</b></font></font></font></font><br />
<br />
Those two sentences betray the killer's nervousness a month after the murder.<br />
<br />
The Cheri Bates murder wasn't a crime of passion.<br />
<br />
The killer INTENDED to cut her throat, nearly decapitating her.<br />
<br />
But he had to make it look like a "normal" murder, and he'd only managed to nick her torso here and there before the slashes that ended her life.<br />
<br />
So he wrote The Confession Letter to make the murder sound as brutal and messy as possible.<br />
<br />
The murder wasn't brutal and messy; it was clinical, if not surgical, in its precision.<br />
<br />
The Confession Letter was definitely written by Cheri Bates's killer.&nbsp; Only the killer would be aware of the unspoken message evident in the autopsy.&nbsp; Only the killer would be motivated to massage that message so the public got the wrong idea.<br />
<br />
