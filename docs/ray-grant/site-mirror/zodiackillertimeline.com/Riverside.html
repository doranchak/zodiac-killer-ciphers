<br />
1, Instead of adding a new page each time I add material to the site, I will do what I've done on TZMS recently and consolidate as much as I can.&nbsp; I will, for example, be working on this Riverside chapter over a period of days or weeks, so the reader may want to come back to it periodically to check for updates.<br />
<br />
2, Rather than discussing more general investigational approaches separately, I will talk about them as they come up in the course of examining the individual incidents.<br />
<br />
Every time I look at conventional aspects of the Zodiac murders, I eventually come to the conclusion that I haven't looked closely enough at what's there, and I decide to go back and up the magnification.<br />
<br />
<b>RIV-01</b><br />
On Sunday morning, October 30, 1966, at 9am, Cheri Bates and her father, Joseph Bates, attended Catholic mass at St. Catherine's Church on Brockton.<br />
<br />
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/e274067fc32a258706d498dc0c4fc533.png"  /><br />
<div style="text-align: left;"><br />
Although nothing that happens Sunday morning is directly related to the murder, there are several observations we can make about the victim just from this scant information so far.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates and I are both baptized Catholics.&nbsp; Practicing Catholics are
required to attend mass every Sunday, and they are also required to
attend mass on Holy Days.&nbsp; On Sunday, October 30, 1966, Cheri Bates knew
she would be returning to St. Catherine's within a couple days.<br />
<br />
<b>Sunday &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monday &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Tuesday<br />
October 30&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; October 31&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; November 1<br />
Devil's Night &nbsp; Halloween &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; All Saint's Day</b><br />
<br />
She could hardly have imagined that her next trip to St. Catherine's would be for her own funeral.<br />
<br />
Several investigators, including Robert Graysmith, have commented on
Cheri Bates having been murdered on the day before Halloween.&nbsp; No one
has pointed out that she was murdered two days before All Saint's Day.<br />
<br />
What does a Catholic Holy Day have to do with Cheri Bates's death?&nbsp; It reminds us that her life was ordered by the logistics of her schedule, her commitments to family, friends, faith, employment, and education.<br />
<br />
If you read Zodiac websites and message boards, you get the impression
that the Zodiac victims were like electrons in a subatomic world.&nbsp; At
any given point in time, it was impossible to predict either their exact
location or velocity (speed plus direction).&nbsp; The actions of the Zodiac
victims were the ultimate manifestation of Heisenberg's Uncertainty
Principle!<br />
<br />
The actions of real people are predictable to an extent fledgling
investigators don't seem to recognize.&nbsp; I'm retired, so I don't have a
set schedule, but I have to take my cat to the veterinarian twice a week
because, at 14, she's experiencing renal failure and has to take fluid
from an IV, like a human going for dialysis.&nbsp; When I go out, which I do
several times a week, I tend to visit the same stores and very often buy
the same things.&nbsp; The baristas at my coffee shop often start making my
favorite drink when they see me in the front window.<br />
<br />
People are predictable.&nbsp; A magazine editor whose mail I delivered for
years wrote an editorial about how she spent all her time in only 3 of
Pittsburgh's neighborhoods (Squirrel Hill, Oakland, and Shadyside).&nbsp; I'm
sure there are exceptions, but I think remarkable consistency is the
rule for the vast majority.<br />
<br />
If you look at True Crime shows on TLC or Discovery ID, you will note
that, most of the time, the perpetrator tends to be the person who
stepped OUT of his daily routine for no apparent reason.&nbsp; The victims,
on the other hand, were doing what they did every day, until that
routine was interrupted.<br />
<br />
I find the random musings of Zodiac message board posters exasperating.&nbsp;
Maybe Cheri Bates went out for dinner by herself, even though she'd
already eaten at her house before she left that day?&nbsp; Maybe she went for
a drive with friends, even though she'd told her father she was going
to the library and had been known to do that in the past, had even been
photographed studying in the library annex?&nbsp; Maybe the outgoing, pretty
blonde cheerleader tiptoed into The RCC Library and kept to herself in
some out-of-the-way corner of the building for 2 hours and 40 minutes?<br />
<br />
The fact is, there's no telling what happened to Cheri Bates that day . .
. unless, like me, you assume that Cheri Bates was Cheri Bates, and
hadn't gone through some alien transformation like the characters in Don
Siegel's <b>Invasion of the Body Snatchers</b>.&nbsp; The Cheri Bates you read about in Robert Graysmith's <b>Zodiac</b>,
and in all other accounts of her murder, particularly those on Zodiac
websites, isn't the real Cheri Bates--it's her pod-person
duplicate!&nbsp; Maybe Cheri fell asleep while the pod sprouted her double,
and was then replaced by a silent sleepwalker who LOOKED like Cheri Bates, but who
ACTED like someone else?<br />
<br />
Cheri walked off into the dark with her killer, when her friends say
she'd NEVER have done that.&nbsp; Cheri left her car unlocked with the
windows down and the keys in the ignition, when her fiance says she'd
NEVER walk away from it without locking it first.&nbsp; Cheri was always
phoning friends and leaving notes for people, telling them what she was
going to do, but after 6:15pm that night, no one saw her or heard from her.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates was predictable, and she behaved in ways that were characteristic of her--except that evening.<br />
<br />
The True Crime accounts got the death right but the victim wrong. </div>
<div style="text-align: left;"><br />
<b>RIV-02</b><br />
After mass, Cheri and her dad ate breakfast at Sandy's Restaurant in The Hardman Center, <br />

<br />
My thanks to Rembrandt from Tom Voigt's site for the photos of Riverside, which are present day, not from 1966.<br />
<br />
Rembrandt and others on Tom's site have pointed up another aspect of Cheri Bates's movements on that day.&nbsp; The patrons and employees at Sandy's Restaurant, which has now been closed for over a decade, still remembered Cheri Bates and the aftermath of her murder.&nbsp; The Cheri Bates murder was the biggest story in Riverside, and remains the most famous homicide in the city's history.&nbsp; It was even recalled that "Bob Barnett", who was the local suspect in the murder until he was cleared by a DNA mismatch, had also been at Sandy's that morning.<br />
<br />
Amateur investigators have speculated that Cheri may have gone driving with friends that evening, or may have eaten at a diner similar to Sandy's, thus explaining how she managed not to be seen by anyone at the library.<br />
<br />
The problem is, it doesn't explain how the friends haven't come forward, or how the people at the restaurant didn't remember seeing her.&nbsp; The ironic thing is, her killer DID come forward with his own version of events, in The Confession Letter.&nbsp; So why wouldn't those who honestly wanted her murder solved come forward as well?<br />
<br />
It's because no one saw her.<br />
<br />
If Cheri Bates had been out and about that evening, people would have reported seeing her, just as they saw her in Sandy's that morning.&nbsp; The most likely explanation for no one reporting seeing her is that no one saw her. <br />
<br />
The absence of witnesses who saw Cheri Bates that evening is all the more striking when one realizes the notoriety of her murder and the dearth of reports of her whereabouts.&nbsp; People would not have been reluctant to volunteer whatever they might have seen that night, when the police were asking on the front page of the paper for witnesses to come forward with anything they had.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates was seen at church, she was seen at Sandy's, she was seen outside the library that afternoon, and she was seen driving by a couple of witnesses, the latter of whom didn't know who she was, but reported seeing someone who fit her description in an alley about a block from RCC.<br />
<br />
If no one reported seeing her after that incident, it's because they didn't see her.<br />
<br />
If they didn't see her, it's because she wasn't there.<br />
<br />
Here's something else to think about:<br />
<br />
When Cheri and her dad walked into Sandy's Restaurant that morning, they sat down in a booth across from a woman who had already ordered food and was waiting for her order.&nbsp; Cheri and her dad placed their own orders, their waitress came back with the food, Cheri and her dad ate, paid for their meal, and left the restaurant all while the woman sitting across from them waited for her own order to arrive.<br />
<br />
Throughout that time while the woman waited for her order, which I assume was a period of 20 minutes or so, Cheri Bates teased her about having to wait for her food.&nbsp; As far as I know, Cheri had never met the woman before, but Cheri Bates was an extremely outgoing person and confident enough in her social skills that she felt comfortable teasing someone she'd just met about her minor misfortune.<br />
<br />
This is the same Cheri Bates who, if we are to believe the true crime narratives offered by people like Robert Graysmith and Michael Butterfield, walked into The RCC Library at approximately 6:20PM that Sunday evening, stayed inside for 2 hours and 40 minutes, and then walked out as the library closed circa 9PM . . . and didn't speak to a single person in all that time. &nbsp; <br />
<br />
<b>RIV-03</b><br />
At 10am, Joseph Bates left the house to spend the day at the beach.&nbsp; The standard timelines of that day don't elaborate on this raw fact, but if you Google "Riverside Nearest Beach", you get, among other links:<br />
<br />
<b>The closest beach to the city of Riverside in <span id="IL_AD5" class="IL_AD">California</span>
State is probably Newport, providing that you travel on the sign-posted
roads. Newport Beach can be accessed by taking the 91 West route out of
Riverside until you reach the 55 South, which takes you direct to your
destination. The beach offers a broad <span id="IL_AD8" class="IL_AD">range</span> of leisure <span id="IL_AD3" class="IL_AD">activities</span>
for visitors, including surfing, body boarding, sandcastle building and
hiking. For families with young children and couples on <span id="IL_AD6" class="IL_AD">romantic getaways</span>
alike, Newport is the perfect beach location with its vast selection of
bars and eateries - including the popular Balboa Bar and Newport Harbor
Caf&#233;.<br />
<br />
Alternatively, you can </b>
<b><span id="IL_AD10" class="IL_AD">visit</span> Huntington's Beach from Riverside. By <span id="IL_AD2" class="IL_AD">car</span>, this is a little further away than Newport, but only by ten minutes driving - providing, of course, that the traffic <span id="IL_AD4" class="IL_AD">leading</span>
out of Riverside is free of congestion and smooth-running. Huntington's
Beach is popular with dog owners because of its stretch of coastline
that's dedicated to dogs so that they can stretch their legs on
California's golden sands. However, this isn't to say that humans can't
also enjoy Huntington's Beach, because there are plenty of other activities <span id="IL_AD9" class="IL_AD">for you</span> to enjoy there as well as your canine companion. These include <span id="IL_AD1" class="IL_AD">water sports</span>,
fishing, adventure touring, paddling in the well-maintained sea and
kite flying. There's also access to horseback rides over the sands at
night, with surfing and body boarding tuition classes for beginners
available on request.</b><br />
<br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Keep in mind that the information here is circa 2012 and not 1966, but we can safely assume that the driving distances haven't changed too much.&nbsp; Don't laugh--traffic congestion in various large cities, including Los Angeles and Houston, have significantly impacted travel times in and out of those cities in the past 50 years or so.&nbsp; In any case, the driving time to Newport Beach from Riverside would have been roughly an hour, and to Huntington Beach about an hour and ten minutes.<br />
<br />
As far as I'm aware, no one has commented on the living arrangement of Joseph Bates and his daughter in the 45+ years since her murder, despite the hundreds of posts on Zodiac message boards in the past 14 years or so.<br />
<br />
Joseph Bates leaves his house at 4195 Via San Jose at 10am that Sunday morning to spend the day at the beach.&nbsp; The drive to Newport Beach would take about an hour, which means he would arrive there around 11am.&nbsp; We also know that Joseph arrived back at his house just after 5pm that evening, which means he'd have left Newport around 4pm.<br />
<br />
<b>11am-4pm&nbsp; Joseph Bates is at Newport Beach</b><br />
<br />
He may, of course, have gone to Huntington Beach instead.&nbsp; In any case, we now know that Joseph spent about two hours driving back and forth to the beach, and he spent about five hours AT the beach.&nbsp; Because it was the end of October, and it started getting dark just after 6pm, we can speculate that Joseph left the beach because the sun was starting to fade and in anticipation of the long drive back to Riverside.<br />
<br />
We can also speculate that he anticipated getting home in time to make dinner for his daughter.&nbsp; The division of labor in the household, according to newspaper accounts, was that Joseph did the cooking and Cheri washed the dishes.&nbsp; If Joseph left the beach at 4pm in anticipation of an hour's drive, which would then have him arriving home at 5pm, he may have intended to cook dinner then.&nbsp; But when he arrived home, he found Cheri's note taped to the refrigerator door (further evidence that they may have tentatively agreed to have dinner together when he got home around 5pm), and then went back out himself, after taking a phone call from Cheri's friend Stephanie and leaving his own note taped to the refrigerator door.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates and her father were close.&nbsp; They lived together in a small house, and Cheri's note to her dad, and the note he left for her on his brief return, suggests strongly that they were in the habit of telling each other what they were doing and where they were going.&nbsp; I also suspect that, since they did live in a small house, they also took care to give each other sufficient space to breathe.&nbsp; If Cheri planned on studying for her term paper that day, Joseph might then take the opportunity to spend the day at the beach and be out of her way.<br />
<br />
Joseph's being out of the way might explain something else about Cheri's movements that morning and afternoon.<br />
<br />
<b>RIV-04<br />
</b>What did Cheri Bates do between 10am, when her father left for the beach, and 3pm, when she called Stephanie?<br />
<br />
We know Cheri made her initial call to her friend Stephanie at 3pm that afternoon, so . . . what did she do between 10am and 3pm?&nbsp; She wasn't seen anywhere and she wasn't heard from for those five hours, so where was she and what was she doing?&nbsp; Most likely, she was inside her house.<br />
<br />
That Cheri didn't discover that her bibliography was missing until she called her friend Donna at 5:30pm strongly suggests that she probably didn't go through her school paperwork at the house, and the absence of reports of other phone calls suggests that she didn't call anyone.<br />
<br />
Maybe she did housework?&nbsp; We know that, in addition to her school work, Cheri had two part-time jobs, one as a clerk/typist at RCC, and the other as a teller at a local bank, plus she was a cheerleader for RCC, so she would not have had a lot of time to do cleaning and laundry at her house.&nbsp; In addition, we know she'd spent the previous weekend in San Francisco seeing her fiance and meeting his parents.&nbsp; So the most logical assumption we can make is that she spent those five hours, between 10am and 3pm, putzing around the house cleaning and doing other chores, and this is probably what she told her dad she was going to do while he spent the day at the beach.<br />
<br />
It's entirely possible that her dad suggested at some point that she go to Newport Beach with him, and that Cheri declined because this was her chance to catch up on work around the house.<br />
<br />
I would suggest that the movements of both Joseph Bates that morning and Cheri Bates late that afternoon are consistent with the desire to stay out of each other's way, and shows the level of sensitivity that one would expect of a father and daughter who were very close.&nbsp; Joseph goes to the beach so he's not in Cheri's way as she does housework, OR Cheri opts to stay at the house to catch up on housework while her dad (who is, after all, single) has fun at the beach.&nbsp; Cheri decides to work on her term paper that evening at The RCC Library, so when her dad comes home he can watch TV if he wants, and she does housework during the day when she's alone so doing it later doesn't disturb him.&nbsp; If you're sharing a small house with someone, you want to do the vacuuming when the other person is out, if possible.<br />
<br />
Joseph Bates had a background in the defense industry; he was a skilled technician, and his daughter was an honor student who was intelligent, outgoing, and clearly responsible.&nbsp; Her employment record speaks to her trustworthiness.&nbsp; One would expect their living arrangements and time management to be orderly and well thought-out, and that's the impression their movements on that day give us.<br />
<br />
<b>RIV-05</b><br />
What did Cheri Bates do between 3pm, the time of her initial call to her friend Stephanie, and 3:45pm, when she called her back?<br />
<br />
Before we consider that question, let&#8217;s backtrack for just a moment.<br />
<br />
Remember what I said at the beginning of this chapter?<br />
<br />
"Every time I look at conventional aspects of the Zodiac murders, I eventually come to the conclusion that I haven't looked closely enough at what's there, and I decide to go back and UP the magnification.&#8221;<br />
<br />
For the past 14 years, message board posters have looked at the raw facts of the Zodiac investigation and speculated randomly about this or that detail.  The best conversations along these lines were to be found on Tom Voigt&#8217;s original archived message board, which is a reflection of the all-star lineup to be found there (though the very best Zodiac researcher, Ray Grant, chose NOT to post there for reasons of his own).<br />
<br />
But even Tom&#8217;s original board failed to take a systematic approach to the timeline.  They tended, instead, to focus on a particular aspect of the murders, such as what specific weapon the Zodiac might have used at Lake Herman Road.  My own speculations about the contents of Cheri Bates&#8217;s stomach were prompted by a comment by William Baker on Tom&#8217;s board on Friday, June 27, 2003 - 10:08 am:<br />
<br />
<b>Based on whatever I have gained through osmosis regarding forensic pathology (as a lay person working closely with board-certified forensic pathologists, along with voracious reading on the subject, over many years, it's surprising how much one can learn), there is one point I wanted to make regarding the digestion of stomach contents in homicide victims. <br />
<br />
<i>While it is almost certainly not a significant factor in the Bates killing, given what is known about the time line and other circumstances that evening,</i> it is interesting to note that when a person is subjected to a life-threatening situation over an extended period of time (as in cases where there is an abduction with a persistent threat of death staring them in the face), the digestive process is retarded, if not halted altogether, while the system prioritizes and rechannels its emphasis to the flight-or-fight areas of the body. <br />
<br />
This has been the case when such murder victims are found to have undigested food in their stomachs, even beyond the 4-6 hours that it normally takes to empty after they ingested their last known meal. Again, there's no indication that Bates was subjected to any more than a blitz-style attack, unexpected and sudden, with no appreciable period of time for this digestive retardation to come into play. But I thought I'd mention it.</b><br />
<br />
I bring this up because it demonstrates how even a very valuable insight can be lost when there&#8217;s no context to put it in.  William Baker was, of course, wrong about the circumstances.  What SEEMED to be known about the time line of Cheri Bates&#8217;s murder back in 2003 (the narrative put forth in The Confession Letter, for example) turns out to be impossible; things could not possibly have happened that way.  Therefore, the undigested food found in the victim&#8217;s stomach is EXTREMELY significant.<br />
<br />
Mind you, the stomach contents don&#8217;t stand alone in my analysis; they simply back up what I&#8217;m saying elsewhere.<br />
<br />
And what I&#8217;m saying, for the most part, is that CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING.<br />
<br />
If I appear to be doing &#8220;micro-analysis&#8221; at times where it isn&#8217;t called for, that&#8217;s why.<br />
<br />
I want, in constructing this timeline, to nail down everything that can be nailed down.  Because if I don&#8217;t, dedicated Zodiac researchers will pick up what ISN&#8217;T nailed down and run with it.<br />
<br />
<b>Wait&#8212;if Cheri Bates had roast beef in her stomach when they did her autopsy, maybe she went out and ate beef stew in a diner that night?</b><br />
<br />
Maybe.  Except she had roast beef and vegetables for supper back at her house between 4pm and 5pm that afternoon.  So we have to assume that the roast beef and vegetables found in her stomach during her autopsy was the same roast beef and vegetables she ate at her house before 5pm . . . in the absence of evidence to the contrary.<br />
<br />
And there IS no evidence to the contrary.  No one at any eating establishment reported seeing Cheri Bates that evening (even though people at Sandy&#8217;s Restaurant that morning remembered seeing her and even remembered what she did), and everything Cheri said to anyone (Stephanie, Donna, her dad) indicated her intention to spend the evening at the library.<br />
<br />
It is my contention that, in pursuing this course of connecting the dots of Cheri Bates&#8217;s last day, and NOT being content with just regurgitating the raw facts without processing them, we will not only arrive at the truth, but also avoid most of the more obvious false steps.<br />
<br />
So . . . what did Cheri Bates do between that first call to her friend Stephanie at 3pm and the second call at 3:45pm?<br />
<br />
The logical answer is that she put the phone down, made a mental note to call again in 45 minutes, and then began preliminary preparations for going to the library, perhaps by taking a shower (after having spent five hours doing housework), changing clothes, and putting on makeup.<br />
<br />
Remember, Cheri likely did NOT go through her course paperwork, since she didn&#8217;t discover that the term paper bibliography was missing until 5:30pm, when she called Donna on the phone.  And she probably did NOT go back to doing housework, since calling Stephanie would likely have been something she&#8217;d do AFTER finishing her housework, and would represent a transition toward spending the evening working on her term paper.  People like Cheri Bates, who have many ongoing activities in their lives (school, cheerleading, two part-time jobs, a fianc&#233; in San Francisco, and keeping house with her dad) are able to do all those things by focusing on one task at a time.<br />
<br />
So the most likely answer to the question is that Cheri began preparations for the evening ahead by showering/changing clothes/putting on makeup, or other &#8220;transitional&#8221; tasks, and that those activities were "bookended" by the phone calls at 3pm and 3:45pm.<br />
<br />
<b>RIV-06</b><br />
Cheri Bates called her friend Stephanie at 3:45pm and asked if she wanted to go to the library with her that afternoon.  Stephanie declined.<br />
<br />
Just to quickly deal with a possible objection: obviously, there&#8217;s no way of knowing that Cheri Bates didn&#8217;t just sit down at her kitchen table that Sunday morning, and spend the next five hours reading the Sunday paper.  She may have done just that.  We&#8217;re constructing a timeline of likely events here, not trying to establish facts that are inherently unknowable.  We will never know EXACTLY what Cheri Bates did the last day of her life.  If I say that doing housework for five hours was a likely activity for her, considering the circumstances of her life at that point, I&#8217;m making a choice.  Much of what happened to Cheri Bates that day CAN be established with reasonable certainty.  The five hour gap between 10am and 3pm is the longest period of uncertainty within that day, but even there we can make assumptions about what Cheri most likely did, especially since we know what she probably DIDN&#8217;T do (for example, she probably DIDN&#8217;T look at her course paperwork, since her bibliography was missing and she didn&#8217;t mention that to Stephanie).<br />
<br />
A further advantage in establishing likely activities during gaps is that it helps fill in the picture of that day; what she did prior to leaving the house bears witness to her movements away from the house and vice-versa.  If we can establish likely activities during the times when she was alone, they may better explain the glimpses we catch of her later on.  Conversely, if we don&#8217;t make some reasonable assumptions about what she was doing earlier, we may make all sorts of UNlikely suppositions about what happened later (such as that she went to a diner at some point, which doesn&#8217;t make sense given what she said to her friends and her father).<br />
<br />
Let&#8217;s quickly review that day as we have it so far:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>1. Cheri Bates and her father went to Catholic mass at St. Catherine&#8217;s at 9am.<br />
<br />
2. After mass, Cheri and her dad ate breakfast at Sandy's Restaurant in The Hardman Center.<br />
<br />
3. At 10am, Joseph Bates left the house to spend the day at the beach, probably Newport.<br />
<br />
4. Between 10am and 3pm, Cheri most likely did housework.<br />
<br />
5. At 3pm, Cheri called Stephanie.  Getting no answer, she likely changed and got ready to leave.</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Cheri must have known that The RCC Library closed for a supper break between 5pm and 6pm.  So if she called Stephanie initially around 3pm, that suggests the possibility that she wanted to, or was at least open to, getting herself to the library PRIOR to its closing.  Since the drive to the library was 10-15 minutes, that might have given Cheri something like an hour and a half at the library that afternoon:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>3pm: Call Stephanie, arrange to meet at the library by 3:30pm or so.<br />
<br />
3pm-3:15pm: Freshen up quickly, change clothes, grab her class paperwork.<br />
<br />
3:15pm-3:30pm: Drive to The RCC Library</b><br />
<br />
<br />
As I said, this would give Cheri about an hour-and-a-half at the library that afternoon, as opposed to the 2 hours and 40 minutes she would have had if she&#8217;d arrived at the library that evening.<br />
<br />
Granted, an hour-and-a-half is probably stretching it, but the possibility of her driving to the library earlier illustrates two things: 1, Cheri, who was an extremely social person, wanted to go to the library WITH Stephanie if possible&#8212;this further underscores how unlikely it was that Cheri could be in The RCC Library for 2 hours and 40 minutes that night without talking to anyone; and 2, Cheri wanted to get back home shortly after 5pm so she could have dinner with her dad.<br />
<br />
It seems unlikely that her dad would have gone to the beach that day without suggesting to Cheri when he would probably come home&#8212;around 5pm or so.  It seems reasonable to assume that Cheri would thus be prepared to spend just over an hour at the library with her friend that afternoon and then drive home in time to have supper with her father.  That&#8217;s the sort of person Cheri was, and that still left open the possibility of her returning to the library that evening after having dinner with her dad.<br />
<br />
But when Cheri finally made the connection with Stephanie, it was already 3:45pm, which, even if she had showered, changed clothes, and gotten ready to leave in between the calls, would have left her less than an hour to spend at the library after she drove there.<br />
<br />
And Stephanie declined the invitation.<br />
<br />
So when Cheri put the phone down, she&#8217;d have considered TWO possibilities:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>1, drive to the library, spend less than an hour inside, then drive back home to have dinner; or<br />
<br />
2, make dinner, eat dinner, and then leave the house for the library, where she could go through her course paperwork outside while waiting for the library to reopen at 6pm.</b><br />
<br />
<br />
We know, from various witness accounts, that (2) is the choice Cheri made.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>It was revealed that Cheri Jo had cooked roast beef Sunday afternoon and had eaten before leaving her home.</b>  <i>Inside Detective Magazine, January 1969</i><br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.zodiackiller.com/InsideDetective6.html">http://www.zodiackiller.com/InsideDetective6.html<br />
</a><br />
<br />
I&#8217;m citing a detail here from the Inside Detective Magazine edition of January 1969, but the article contains at least one glaring inconsistency.  On page 5, it has the Mexican-American student seeing Cheri Bates outside the library at 5:30pm; on page 7, it has Cheri Bates, or someone dressed just like her, arriving outside the library at 5:40pm and then going inside at 6pm and charging out the books found inside her car.  As I will demonstrate when I get to that point, Cheri Bates could not possibly have charged books out at 6pm that evening, unless we&#8217;re willing to throw out two witnesses who saw her driving TOWARD the library after 6pm, and also question the account of the Mexican-American student who saw her at 5:30pm.<br />
<br />
I think it much more likely that Riverside PD could simply not account for Cheri Bates&#8217;s whereabouts after 6:15pm that night, and therefore assumed that, since charged-out books were found on the front seat of her car, she must have hurried inside when the library reopened at 6pm and charged the books out at that time, and then immediately left the library.  Thus the wording on page 7: &#8220;It has been determined that . . .&#8221;<br />
<br />
The 5:40pm-6pm timeline had been &#8220;determined&#8221; by police because, as far as Riverside PD was concerned, they had eliminated every other possibility; unfortunately, THAT possibility is also impossible . . . as we shall see momentarily.<br />
<br />
<b>It was revealed that Cheri Jo had cooked roast beef Sunday afternoon and had eaten before leaving her home.</b>  <i>Inside Detective Magazine, January 1969</i><br />
<br />
Apparently Joseph Bates returned home shortly after 5pm that evening and found dishes in the sink and/or leftovers in the refrigerator.  The Inside Detective article cites Riverside Police Department personnel as its primary source, thus, we can assume this is information they got from Cheri&#8217;s dad.<br />
<br />
The only bit of information we have that might be in conflict with this supposition is the note Cheri left taped to the refrigerator prior to leaving the house: DAD&#8212;WENT TO RCC LIBRARY.<br />
<br />
The note makes no mention of her having prepared supper; perhaps that was simply self-evident, and it&#8217;s possible that Cheri had already told her dad that morning that she would probably cook supper herself.  That she felt she had to leave the note suggests that she DIDN&#8217;T tell her dad that morning that she was going to the library that evening.  Or perhaps she did mention it as a possibility, and the note was simply confirmation of where she was headed.   <br />
<br />
But wouldn&#8217;t cooking dinner herself have represented a break from what her dad would expect, since the division of labor in the household was that Joseph cooked and Cheri washed dishes?<br />
<br />
In considering questions such as this, I have a considerable advantage over other Zodiac researchers, most of whom are a generation or so younger than I am and were very young children when the Zodiac crimes took place.  Why, Mike Butterfield wasn&#8217;t even conceived yet when Cheri Bates was murdered!  Yet another aspect of the crime that leads us to reflect, &#8220;If only we could go back and somehow prevent some things from happening . . .&#8221;<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates was born on February 4, 1948; I was born on April 29, 1951.  She died when she was 18 &#189; and I was 15 &#189;.<br />
<br />
In 1966, there were no microwaves, no induction cooktops, no Jet Stream ovens.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to have roast beef and vegetables for supper, the cooking time was a bit longer than it might be today.  For starters, most supermarkets weren&#8217;t open on Sunday in 1966, so chances are both the roast beef and vegetables were frozen prior to preparation.  We can assume that Cheri had the foresight to start thawing the meat earlier in the day, and even in 1966 making vegetables would have come down to taking a small rectangular package out of the freezer, putting the contents in a pot with a lid on, and heating for 10 minutes or so, but the meat would have taken longer.<br />
<br />
She would have put the roast in the oven just after talking to Stephanie, and assuming average cooking times in a conventional oven, could have expected to have supper ready by 4:30pm or so.  If she doesn&#8217;t start making supper around 4pm, and instead waits for her dad to come home sometime after 5pm, which would probably have been closer to their usual supper time, now she&#8217;s very likely cutting into her study time that evening, since it&#8217;s unlikely her dad could cook dinner and give Cheri time to get to the library by the time it reopened at 6pm.  Someone as organized as Cheri Bates would probably not want to wait that long to get to the library; she would likely have preferred to have a &#8220;chunk of time&#8221; to work on her term paper.<br />
<br />
If Cheri Bates cooked roast beef between 4pm and 4:30pm that Sunday, there would have been leftovers in the fridge, assuming she didn&#8217;t eat an entire roast herself for supper.  In 1966, people typically would cook a roast in the oven and then, if the entire roast wasn&#8217;t consumed by a family at suppertime, the remains of the roast would be put in a container and either eaten as leftovers or possibly used for sandwiches.<br />
<br />
One last possibility along these lines is that what Cheri cooked on Sunday afternoon was already leftovers that she&#8217;d taken from a container in the refrigerator.  Just going by my own experience, people in 1966 would be more likely to have roast beef for Sunday supper; Saturday night fare for the middle class in the 1960s would be hot dogs or something less of a sit-down dinner meal.  Keep in mind that Catholics like Cheri and myself would always have fish on Fridays&#8212;in my house it was usually fish sticks with spaghetti, and on Saturdays we&#8217;d have hot dogs and beans.<br />
<br />
In any case, Cheri Bates had roast beef and vegetables for supper, which she ate between 4:30pm-5pm.  Whether this was apparent to Joseph because Cheri left the dishes in the sink, or because she left a container full of leftovers in the fridge, or both, is secondary.<br />
<br />
Since we know Joseph Bates returned home just after 5pm, which was just after Cheri left, and since we know he read the note taped to the refrigerator, took a call from Stephanie, and then left a note of his own (probably also taped to the refrigerator) and then went back out again . . . we can assume Joseph Bates was back inside the house about 10-15 minutes, if that.<br />
<br />
<b>5pm-5:15pm Joseph Bates returns home, reads the note, takes a call, leaves a note of his own, and then goes back out again.</b><br />
<br />
We&#8217;ve gotten ahead of ourselves here.  Let&#8217;s go back and connect the dots of the timeline.<br />
<br />
<b>RV-07</b><br />
Cheri Bates cooked roast beef and vegetables for herself between 4pm and 4:30pm.<br />
<br />
<b>RV-09</b><br />
Cheri Bates ate the roast beef and vegetables she&#8217;d prepared between 4:30pm and 5pm.<br />
<br />
If you&#8217;re paying attention, you will notice that there&#8217;s a gap between those two items!<br />
<br />
Here&#8217;s what belongs in the gap:<br />
<br />
<b>RV-08</b><br />
Friends of Cheri Bates walked by her house at 4:30pm and noticed her car parked outside. <br />
<br />
At about 4:30pm that afternoon, friends of Cheri Bates walked past her house and noticed that her lime green VW Beetle was parked outside.  This sighting both underscores Cheri's popularity and her visibility.  People LIKED Cheri Bates, but more important for our examination of her last day, they NOTICED her and things about her, such as her car being parked outside her house that afternoon.<br />
<br />
Does everyone see the dichotomy here?<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates goes to church that morning and has breakfast in Sandy&#8217;s Restaurant.  People from the restaurant recall her being there that morning and teasing the woman who was waiting for her order.  Then she goes home and is by herself inside her house for the next 7 hours . . . and people walking by are STILL aware of her presence though no one actually sees her.<br />
<br />
BUT . . . the Graysmith/Butterfield timeline of Cheri&#8217;s last day has her walking into The RCC Library circa 6:20pm and not being noticed by anyone for 2 hours and 40 minutes, followed by another 1 hour and 30 minutes outside in front of the library.  After 6:15pm that night, Cheri Bates was not seen or heard from by anyone, and did not speak to anyone for 4 hours and 15 minutes until the time of her murder at 10:30pm.<br />
<br />
Maybe there are murder victims who were out and about under their own power for 4+ hours prior to their murders who managed to remain silent and unnoticed during that entire time, despite being in the physical midst of dozens of potential witnesses.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates is not one of those victims.<br />
<br />
The Cheri Bates that her friends and acquaintances knew and experienced, even on that last day of her life, would NOT have remained silent and unnoticed for 4+ hours.  It is simply not possible.<br />
<br />
At the risk of being accused of beating a dead horse, let me review our progress to this point:<br />
<br />
<br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>1. Cheri Bates and her father went to Catholic mass at St. Catherine&#8217;s at 9am.<br />
<br />
</b>This tells us that Cheri had a personal schedule; her life was planned and thought-out in advance.<br />
<br />
<b>
<br />
2. After mass, Cheri and her dad ate breakfast at Sandy's Restaurant in The Hardman Center.</b><br />
<br />
Cheri teased a fellow diner because she hadn't received her order; Cheri Bates was playful and outgoing.<br />
<br />
<b>
<br />
3. At 10am, Joseph Bates left the house to spend the day at the beach, probably Newport.<br />
<br />
</b>Again, this is consistent with two people living in a small house keeping out of each other's way.<br />
<br />
<b>
<br />
4. Between 10am and 3pm, Cheri most likely did housework.<br />
<br />
</b>Cheri's weekdays would have been busy, and Saturday would have been the logical time for things like cheerleading practice or working at the bank in the morning.&nbsp; When I was a student in parochial school, we traveled to St. Mary's Seminary once a year, in the fall, and I was surprised to find out from one of the students that the "weekend" at St. Mary's was actually Thursday/Sunday, NOT Saturday/Sunday, because splitting the "off" days broke up the week more.&nbsp; Cheri Bates had a full class schedule, two part-time jobs, cheerleading, and a fiance she had just visited the previous weekend.&nbsp; It's reasonable to assume she would use that Saturday to take it easy and relax, and schedule things like housework and her term paper for Sunday.<br />
<b>
<br />
<br />
5. At 3pm, Cheri called Stephanie.  Getting no answer, she likely showered, changed, and got ready to leave.</b></font><br />
</font>
<br />
Again, the logical sequence would be: a), her dad leaves for the beach; b), she does laundry, vacuuming, cleaning, and other housework between 10am and 3pm, and, having finished those chores, c), she calls Stephanie at 3pm.&nbsp; Not getting an answer, she showers, changes clothes, and puts on makeup if she's wearing any that evening.<br />
<br />
<b><br />
6. She calls Stephanie again at 3:45pm and asks if she wants to go to the library.&nbsp; Stephanie declines.</b><br />
<br />
Cheri clearly chose to prepare and eat supper and then spend the evening at the library.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>7. Friends passing her house at 4:30pm notice Cheri's car parked outside.</b><br />
<br />
This puts Cheri in her house at 4:30pm.&nbsp; Since we know that Cheri was out and about under her own power up until 6:15pm, the presence of her car outside her house means she was inside her house at 4:30pm.<br />
<br />
This means that Cheri left her house sometime between 4:30pm, when her friends saw her car, and 5pm, when her dad returned home from the beach.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>8. Cheri Bates left her house for The RCC Library between 4:30pm and 5pm that Sunday.</b><br />
<br />
We have to assume that Cheri Bates left her house more toward 5pm than 4:30pm, for several reasons:<br />
<br />
a), if she cooked and ate supper between 4pm and 5pm, we would expect that to take a bit longer in 1966 than it might today, thus more toward 5pm;<br />
<br />
b), if she had left the house just after 4:30pm, she would have arrived at The RCC Library before 5pm, since the driving time between her house and The RCC Library was 10-15 minutes.&nbsp; The timeline would look like this:<br />
<br />
<b>Leave 4:30pm, arrive at The RCC Library no later than 4:45pm.<br />
<br />
Leave 4:35pm, arrive at The RCC Library <b>no later than</b> 4:50pm.<br />
<br />
Leave 4:40pm, arrive at The RCC Library <b>no later than</b> 4:55pm.</b><br />
<br />
Granted, Cheri would not have had much time to do anything in the library in the scant minutes before it closed for supper at 5pm.&nbsp; However, two things WOULD have been possible:<br />
<br />
1, Someone would see her; and<br />
<br />
2, She could--very hastily, I'll admit--charge books out.<br />
<br />
Well, we know that no one saw her at the library before it closed at 5pm.<br />
<br />
Police have insisted that Cheri Bates must have charged out books that evening, which is to say, after it reopened at 6pm.<br />
<br />
If the library used an "evening" card to charge out Cheri's books, this would lead Riverside PD to the conclusion it made.<br />
<br />
In 1966, most libraries used a system where a card identifying the book, a card identifying the person borrowing it, and a card identifying the date (and possibly the time in general terms--RCC may have used a MORNING, AFTERNOON, and EVENING card with the specific date) were all photographed together.&nbsp; A librarian charging out a stack of books would only need to change the card identifying the book for each charge-out record to be made.<br />
<br />
Riverside PD has never suggested that Cheri Bates might have charged out books before 5pm.<br />
<br />
Therefore, we should probably assume that the books found on the front seat of her car were charged-out with a card indicating it was done during the EVENING session.<br />
<br />
It is, of course, conceivable that Cheri arrived just prior to the library closing, which would have corresponded to leaving the house circa 4:45pm or so.&nbsp; This seems unlikely.&nbsp; The library entrance figured to be most crowded at 5pm, thus Cheri Bates would most likely be seen by other people around that time, if she was waiting outside the building.&nbsp; But she wasn't seen by anyone at 5pm.<br />
<br />
I suspect the area outside the library was relatively deserted by 5:10pm or so, and Cheri Bates wasn't seen outside the library until 5:30pm, so the most likely time for her to have left her house would have been just prior to 5pm.<br />
<br />
In other words, Cheri Bates and her father just missed each other at the house, probably by 5-10 minutes.&nbsp; I suspect that Cheri left her house circa 4:55pm-5pm, and her father arrived home circa 5:05pm-5:10pm.<br />
<br />
At just after 5pm that evening, Cheri Bates is driving toward The RCC Library for the first time that day.<br />
<br />
Joseph Bates is driving toward their house and is within just a few minutes of reaching it.<br />
<br />
The RCC Library has closed for the supper break between 5pm and 6pm.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates has an hour and fifteen minutes of freedom left to her.&nbsp; If eyes are watching her, prepared to make a move, Cheri is, at the moment, too distracted to notice them.<br />
<br />
<br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>RV-10</b><br />
</font>At just after 5pm that evening, Cheri Bates is driving toward The RCC Library for the first time that day.<br />
<br />
I'm writing this on the morning of Thursday, August 16, 2012.&nbsp; Since Mike Kelleher has expressed curiosity, on ZodiacRevisited.com, as to where ZKT is going, let's pretend we're in the passenger seat of Cheri Bates's lime green VW as she drives toward The RCC Library that Sunday afternoon, just after 5pm, and think about where this process is headed.<br />
<br />
I am, to begin with, retracing my steps on that Sunday for at least the third time, having not been satisfied with the level of detail I'd attained on my first two trips through.&nbsp; That's why I've had earlier timelines up on other websites and taken them down.&nbsp; I'll be re-posting that material shortly, but I wanted to go back to the beginning and see if I'd missed anything on my first couple of trips.<br />
<br />
The typical thread on a Zodiac message board, and I'm talking about ALL of them here--Tom's site, Mike's site, Morf's site--begins with citing some raw fact from a Zodiac event and then various posters weighing in on what that angle MIGHT mean.&nbsp; If we go by when Tom's site originally went up on The Internet, it's now been 14 years of beer &amp; pretzel discussions resulting in absolutely NO conclusions.<br />
<br />
This is not the way to conduct an inquiry into ANYTHING, much less the most notorious unsolved serial murder case of the 20th century.<br />
<br />
I want the reader to participate in a brief experiment with me.<br />
<br />
I want you to stand up in the middle of the room you're in right now.&nbsp; You can just read what I'm saying if you want to, and imagine what I tell you to do, but you'll understand what I'm suggesting only if you actually get up and do what I tell you to do.<br />
<br />
Stand up in the middle of the room.&nbsp; In front of you is North, to your right is East, behind you is South, and to your left is West.&nbsp; So go ahead and make a quarter-turn to the right and face East.&nbsp; Another quarter-turn, and face South.&nbsp; Another quarter-turn, and face West.&nbsp; Now come back to face North.<br />
<br />
The Chinese have a saying: A journey of a thousand miles must begin with a single step.<br />
<br />
Everything that happened to the Zodiac victims happened one moment at a time, and everything began with where they were to begin with.&nbsp; Whatever next movement you make, in whatever direction, will begin with where you are now, and that was true of Cheri Bates and all the other Zodiac victims.<br />
<br />
It may be helpful to think of a timeline as a series of stepping stones in a bubbling stream.&nbsp; The best way to move between the stones is to first get your footing securely on the stone under your feet.&nbsp; Once you have a good feel for where you are, you can move to the next stone with much greater confidence and less fear that you'll end up in the water.<br />
<br />
Zodiac message board posters insist on trying to think several steps ahead, when they haven't established a logical sequence for the movements of the victims, beginning with where they started.&nbsp; More often than not, they speculate about the victims without taking into account who the victims were.&nbsp; That's why most of their speculations are all wet.<br />
<br />
Perhaps there are 18-year-old women in the world who could walk into a community college library and not speak to anyone for 2 hours and 40 minutes, and not be seen by anyone, and then stand out in front of the building for 1 hour and 30 minutes after it closed, and not be noticed by anyone.&nbsp; I doubt it, but perhaps there are teenagers who fade into the backdrop in the midst of dozens of witnesses.<br />
<br />
But if there are such young women, Cheri Bates would not have been one of them.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates could not spend 20 minutes in a diner that morning without being noticed and causing a stir and interacting with a woman she didn't even know, and being remembered by people and staff at the diner.<br />
<br />
It is simply impossible to believe she could have been in the library that night without people recalling her.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates ate roast beef and vegetables before leaving her house at 5pm.&nbsp; Four ounces of roast beef and vegetables were found in her stomach during the same autopsy that estimated her death as having taken place at 10:30pm, which coincided with earwitness reports of screams heard in the area.<br />
<br />
5 hours and 30 minutes.<br />
<br />
An 18-year-old cheerleader eats supper, then spends the evening doing research at the library, and 5 hours and 30 minutes later, when she's murdered, still has 4 ounces of that supper in her stomach.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
<br />
I'm 61 years old, having recently recovered from a long bout with gastritis, and my digestive process is a lot faster than that.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates could not possibly still have food in her stomach when she was murdered, unless something extremely intense happened to her to slow that process down dramatically.<br />
<br />
The lack of eyewitness accounts after Cheri was last seen at 6:15pm, and the presence of food in her stomach many hours after it should have been empty, tells us that Cheri must have been abducted.<br />
<br />
If the account given in The Confession Letter were true, Cheri Bates should have been seen and heard from by MANY witnesses both inside and outside the library, leading up to the attack in the alley, and her stomach should have been empty when she was autopsied.&nbsp; Never mind that her car was left in a condition Cheri Bates would never have left it in, if she'd been moving around under her own power, and never mind that Cheri Bates would NEVER walk down a pitch dark alley with anyone, much less a stranger.<br />
<br />
I'm getting ahead of myself here.&nbsp; I will return to the timeline sequence in a moment, and we'll be sitting back in the passenger seat of Cheri's VW as it pulls up outside The RCC Library between 5:10pm and 5:15pm that Sunday, and we will move forward a moment at a time from there.<br />
<br />
As Mike Kelleher has suggested recently, I am working out the details as I go along.&nbsp; At each point in the narrative, as I look around, new things are occurring to me.&nbsp; I will eventually post an article called <b>Riverside Timeline</b>, which will simplify the sequence.&nbsp; I will then do an article called <b>Lake Herman Road</b>, and after I've analyzed what happened there, I will post an article called <b>Lake Herman Road Timeline</b>, and so on.<br />
<br />
In other words, I will attempt to explore every realistic possibility and then, when I've determined which sequence makes the most sense to me, post an article which connects those dots.<br />
<br />
In other words, instead of just citing raw facts and speculating randomly, I will process information, establish the most realistic narrative sequence based on what the witnesses say and how the victims were known to behave, and . . . drum roll . . . come to CONCLUSIONS.<br />
<br />
These crimes took place more than 4 decades ago.<br />
<br />
Are Zodiac websites EVER going to say, "This is what we think happened."?<br />
<br />
Before I drop this train of thought and move on, I do want to cite the single example of what I've been suggesting here, from the Zodiologists website.&nbsp; By the way, if anyone knows who specifically is behind that site, I'm curious to know, since I'm plugging them here:<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.zodiologists.com/confession_letter_comments_conclusions.html">Zodiologists on The Confession Letter<br />
</a><br />
I don't endorse every aspect of their conclusion here, but I commend their approach.&nbsp; Bravo!<br />
<br />
More to come momentarily.<br />
