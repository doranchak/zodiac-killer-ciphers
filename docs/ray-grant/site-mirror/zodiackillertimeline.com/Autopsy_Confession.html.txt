There's been a fair amount of speculation recently as to the authenticity of
The Confession Letter.  Riverside PD has always believed it was written by
Cheri Bates's killer, mainly because of the reference to the middle wire of the
distributor being pulled out.

I myself believe that The Confession Letter was written by Cheri's killer, but
I think the distributor wire is less significant than the writer's reference to
the knife he used to commit the murder.

Here's the critical passage from The Confession Letter:

II PPLLUUNNGGEEDD TTHHEE KKNNIIFFEE IINNTTOO HHEERR AANNDD IITT
BBRROOKKEE..  II TTHHEENN FFIINNIISSHHEEDD TTHHEE JJOOBB BBYY CCUUTTTTIINNGG HHEERR TTHHRROOAATT..

Since we've just looked at the autopsy in detail, here's the obvious question:

Is there evidence anywhere in that autopsy that the killer broke his knife off
into the victim?

If there is, maybe the reader can point it out to me.  I didn't see it, and I
literally retyped the entire autopsy report.

When a medical examiner finds a wound on a body, he normally probes that wound,
either with an instrument or with the tips of his fingers.  This is done even
when the autopsy being performed is that of a dead President, as happened at
Bethesda Naval Hospital in November 1963.  Once the surface of the body is
examined, the autopsy surgeon then opens up the torso to examine the internal
organs, as we saw in the Cheri Bates autopsy report.

No broken-off blade from the killer's knife was noted anywhere on or in her
body.

However, it's possible that the broken-off blade fell back out of the body,
isn't it?

TThhee ddiirrtt iinn aa rraaddiiuuss ooff 1122 ffeeeett aarroouunndd tthhee bbooddyy wwaass hhaanndd ssiifftteedd ttoo aa ddeepptthh ooff

Another way of saying this is that no broken-off blade was found by the autopsy
surgeon, and no broken-off blade was found by any of the crime scene
technicians.

I suppose it's possible that the killer inadvertently kicked the broken-off
blade after it fell out of the victim's body, or that the broken-off blade
ricocheted out of her body so violently that it fell to earth outside that 12-
foot radius . . . but if that's true, then the writer of The Confession Letter
killed the victim after all, right?

II PPLLUUNNGGEEDD TTHHEE KKNNIIFFEE IINNTTOO HHEERR AANNDD IITT

If the writer of The Confession Letter was telling the truth, there should have
been some evidence of his knife having broken when he stabbed the victim . . .
and there wasn't.  There was a single laceration of the 5th rib, a bone which
might be hard enough to break the knife, but no fracture of the rib and no sign
of the broken blade.

So why would he say that the knife broke?

The autopsy, taken at face value, tells us that the killer never stabbed the
victim.  The wounds to the face are incidental to the throat slashes, the
wounds to the fingers are defensive, and the wounds to the throat are mortal.

That leaves the wounds to the torso, all of which were superficial, none of
which was remotely life-threatening.

It's a knife attack, a crime of rage, in which the victim was never stabbed.

Cheri Bates was murdered 45+ years ago, and yet, no one has questioned her
killer's method.

The reason for that may be found in that single sentence:

II PPLLUUNNGGEEDD TTHHEE KKNNIIFFEE IINNTTOO HHEERR AANNDD IITT BBRROOKKEE..

If there's one thing the killer DIDN'T do, it's plunge his knife into the
victim.

But SAYING that he did has distracted people from looking at what actually
happened.

Note that the killer writes that the knife broke, and THEN he cut her throat:

II PPLLUUNNGGEEDD TTHHEE KKNNIIFFEE IINNTTOO HHEERR AANNDD IITT
BBRROOKKEE..  II TTHHEENN FFIINNIISSHHEEDD TTHHEE JJOOBB BBYY CCUUTTTTIINNGG HHEERR TTHHRROOAATT..

In other words, he was prevented from stabbing the victim because his knife
broke, so his only alternative was to cut the victim's throat ear-to-ear with a
more shallow stroke of his broken blade.

Again, there's no physical evidence that the killer's knife broke.  In
addition, it's hard to imagine how a killer caught up in his own rage, stabbing
a victim in a pitch dark alley, could be aware that his knife had broken. 
There were only a handful of slashes to the torso, and the cuts on the hands
and face were collateral, so how could the killer have known, in total
darkness, that his knife blade had broken?  And how could he act so quickly to
suddenly concentrate on the throat area?

II PPLLUUNNGGEEDD TTHHEE KKNNIIFFEE IINNTTOO HHEERR AANNDD IITT
BBRROOKKEE..  II TTHHEENN FFIINNIISSHHEEDD TTHHEE JJOOBB BBYY CCUUTTTTIINNGG HHEERR TTHHRROOAATT..

Those two sentences betray the killer's nervousness a month after the murder.

The Cheri Bates murder wasn't a crime of passion.

The killer INTENDED to cut her throat, nearly decapitating her.

But he had to make it look like a "normal" murder, and he'd only managed to
nick her torso here and there before the slashes that ended her life.

So he wrote The Confession Letter to make the murder sound as brutal and messy
as possible.

The murder wasn't brutal and messy; it was clinical, if not surgical, in its
precision.

The Confession Letter was definitely written by Cheri Bates's killer.  Only the
killer would be aware of the unspoken message evident in the autopsy.  Only the
killer would be motivated to massage that message so the public got the wrong
idea.
