<b>Hey Ray!  Dave here.  I'm genuinely curious about why you feel the need to bash me on your site.  I couldn't tell from your posts what it was that set you against me.  Maybe it's something I've done that I've forgotten about!<br />
<br />
Regards,<br />
<br />
-Dave (a.k.a., Gareth Penn impersonator)</b><br />
<br />
Hey Dave,<br />
<br />
Looks like I finally got your attention!  I&#8217;ll have to try that Gareth Penn trick with other people.  Maybe it&#8217;ll work on the Mayor of San Francisco?  He hasn&#8217;t returned any of my calls so far.<br />
<br />
You&#8217;ve obviously been reading my websites, so I won&#8217;t repeat what I&#8217;ve said already.<br />
<br />
The point about Gareth was that he insists on putting up puzzles on his blog <a href="http://gz4216.blogspot.com/">GZ 4216</a>; the most interesting puzzle is why Gareth didn&#8217;t bother to sue Michael O&#8217;Hare for publicly holding him up to ridicule in <a href="http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2009/0905.ohare.html">The Washington Monthly article</a>.  I want you to imagine that you&#8217;d spent almost 30 years of your life accusing someone of being the most notorious uncaught serial killer since <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jack_the_Ripper">Jack the Ripper</a>.  Then, one day, that person talks disparagingly about you in an op-ed piece in a national magazine.<br />
<br />
So you instantaneously file suit to get his fingerprints and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mitochondrial_DNA">mtDNA</a>, right?<br />
<br />
Wrong!<br />
<br />
<a href="http://talentdevelop.com/articles/WIIA.html">Isaac Asimov</a> once said that he didn&#8217;t take much pleasure in the scores he got on IQ tests, since he knew how stupid he was in so many areas such tests didn&#8217;t bother to measure.  I feel the same way.  It&#8217;s pointless to make points about Zodiac cryptography if people are ignoring larger issues that are staring them in the face.<br />
<br />
Look, The Cryptogram was a fairly easy multiple substitution cipher, which is why I believe Mike Rodelli&#8217;s hypothesis that some agency (CIA, NSA, FBI, Mensa, American Cryptogram Association) actually solved the puzzle within a few hours, and then The Cryptogram was intentionally altered and put out to see if the killer himself would be stupid enough to point out the discrepancies.  This sort of ruse where police put out an altered version of facts or events hoping that a killer will come forward and correct them is ironically called a &#8220;key&#8221;.  And Donald Gene Harden was considered a suspect in the immediate aftermath of his sending in the &#8220;solution&#8221;.<br />
<br />
Except, of course, that that so-called solution tells us absolutely nothing.  We don&#8217;t know anything more about the killer after The Cryptogram was &#8220;solved&#8221; than we knew before . . . except for which symbols in his puzzle stood for which letters.<br />
<br />
Did you ever read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jim_Bouton">Jim Bouton</a>&#8217;s book, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ball_Four">Ball Four</a>?  At one point, he talks about the patter ballplayers employ during pepper games.  He quotes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankie_Crosetti">Frank Crosetti</a> exclaiming while fielding grounders, &#8220;Hey, the old shillelagh!&#8221;  Bouton says that the patter is true nonlanguage, specifically designed to say nothing.<br />
<br />
That&#8217;s what I say about The Cryptogram&#8217;s &#8220;solution&#8221;, which is specifically designed to distract the reader from its actual intent.  The Zodiac is a master of misdirection, and The Cryptogram is arguably the supreme example of it, since he gets everyone to follow his &#8220;buried treasure&#8221; directions to what looks like a dead end.  And then, when they get there, they give up and walk away, instead of asking themselves what it is they&#8217;ve actually learned about the Zodiac.<br />
<br />
And the answer is: they&#8217;ve learned which symbols stand for which letters.<br />
<br />
And that&#8217;s ALL they&#8217;ve learned.<br />
<br />
Dave, trust me&#8212;that&#8217;s the lesson of The Cryptogram.<br />
<br />
Now try applying that knowledge to The 340.<br />
<br />
All the various brute force solutions you&#8217;re suggesting on ZKF miss the point.<br />
<br />
Since the physical copies of TZMS are where I spend the most time on the cryptography of the case, and since I recently scanned the 1993 edition of my book onto my TZMS website, I&#8217;ll conclude with a cryptographic point.<br />
<br />
Pages 275-276 of <a href="http://thezodiacmurderssolved.com/TZMS_1993-2.html">TZMS 1993-2</a>:<br />
<br />
<b>The most striking result in the digital undertext is ALIGHIERI, the surname of the poet DANTE, a string with which it overlaps the second time.  It is a 23-digit string, which should occur once every 8,388,608 digits.  Here, in the space of about 3,000 digits, it occurs twice.</b><br />
<br />
Keep in mind that the entire Zodiac literature would consist of approximately 40,000 digits, maybe slightly more than that, if you converted every letter of every message into Morse code (and then, both to allow conversions to binary math and to make notation simpler, you used 1 for dash and 0 for dot).<br />
<br />
Any particular 23-digit string showing up at random in a document of that length should happen about once in 200 Zodiac literatures.  For it to happen twice, about once in 50,000 Zodiac literatures.<br />
<br />
Those are long odds.  I&#8217;ve already pointed out the likelihood of EASTER in Morse code showing up in the names of both Vallejo drivers.  A killer would have to terrorize 2500 lovers lanes to duplicate that coincidence.  I tend to think the cops would catch him before he could pull it off.<br />
<br />
Of course, you try explaining that to a Zodiac message board poster, and he just blinks at you.<br />
<br />
Try this exercise, if you don&#8217;t believe me.  Convert a document the size of The Confession Letter to Morse code, and then check it for the strings I found in The Confession Letter, using the SEARCH function of your computer.  It&#8217;s a fairly simple exercise for someone of your expertise.  The strings are cited at <a href="http://thezodiacmurderssolved.com/TZMS_1993-1.html">TZMS 1993-1</a>, pages 118-125.<br />
<br />
Let me tell you what you&#8217;re going to discover for yourself.  You&#8217;ll type in a given string, hit the SEARCH button . . . and nothing.  Over and over and over again.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s because all the Zodiac documents contain undertexts, and non-Zodiac documents (such as the 1978 letter) don&#8217;t.<br />
<br />
That&#8217;s the difference.<br />
<br />
Mike Butterfield has mocked me in The Crackpot Files for saying, &#8220;If you knew more about the case, you&#8217;d have a different opinion.  Trust me.&#8221;<br />
<br />
When I said that to Tom DiMarco, it was the cryptographic undertexts I was talking about.  That&#8217;s how you know the Zodiac isn&#8217;t <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mr._Magoo">Mr. Magoo</a>.  But even if you don&#8217;t look at the documents, the conventional aspects of the crimes tell you the same thing.  As Michael Cole recently pointed out, the level of Premeditated Situational Control is what gives it away.  There was nothing random about what he did.</font></div></div></div></div>
