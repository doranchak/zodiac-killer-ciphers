Those of you who watch my videos know that I have _s_p_a_s_m_o_d_i_c_ _d_y_s_p_h_o_n_i_a, a
neurological disorder where the muscles around my vocal folds clench
involuntarily. Every couple of months I get a double injection of _b_o_t_o_x, one on
each side of my throat, which relaxes the muscles temporarily and allows me to
have a relatively normal voice.

I went for the injections on Monday afternoon, and took the opportunity to ask
my doctor about Cheri Batess voice box. The first thing the doctor told me was
that it is virtually impossible to decapitate anyone with a knife. The bones of
the spine are sturdy enough that youd need an axe or a guillotine to cut
completely through the neck. However, since the larynx itself is located in the
front of the throat, and since the victim's thyroid cartilage is described as
deeply cut on each side, it seems reasonable to assume that the voice box was
compromised.

I'm wondering, having looked at this passage several times in recent weeks, if
I haven't misread what the medical examiner was trying to say here.  If you
read that paragraph carefully, the autopsy surgeon appears to be asking why the
victim wouldn't scream and run AFTER her throat was cut.

But I'm not sure that's what he's saying after all.

I think what Dr. Modglin means is, WHY WOULD THE VICTIM JUST STAND THERE AND
ALLOW HER THROAT TO BE CUT BY A SINGLE ASSAILANT, WHEN THERE WERE NO OTHER
DISABLING WOUNDS ANYWHERE ON HER BODY?

My doctor agrees with me, and disagrees with what the medical examiner seems to
be saying here. If her carotid artery and jugular veins were transected, she
would likely lose consciousness very quickly and die within minutes, and
therefore could not have run away once her throat was cut.

But, oddly enough, that's what the medical examiner DOES say at first:

AAss tthhee rreessuulltt ooff tthhee rraappiidd bblloooodd lloossss tthhee ssuubbjjeecctt wwoouulldd ggoo llaattee sshhoocckk rraappiiddllyy

If your throat is cut, you pass out in a matter of seconds and die within
minutes.

So what the medical examiner is actually saying is, WHY DIDN'T SHE RUN WHEN SHE
HAD THE CHANCE?

My doctor told me that had the victims larynx been cut through, she could not
have screamed.

And yet, a witness in the area reported hearing "an awful scream" circa 10:
30pm.

So we know Cheri Bates probably screamed before she was murdered.

If she had time to scream, she had time to get away.

But that's assuming there was only one killer.

Heres something else to think about. The medical examiner stated that the
knife used was at least 3 ½ inches long and a half inch wide. That means that
the knife blade was 7 times longer than it was wide.

If the knife blade is 7 times longer than it is wide, what sort of wound
pattern would we expect, assuming the murder is a crime of passion?

We would expect, for the most part, relatively short marks on the surface of
the skin, and deep cuts.

The autopsy reveals that the majority of the wounds on the body were
superficial. The surface lacerations were actually longer than the wounds were
deep, with the exception of the neck area. This is consistent with a slashing
attack, and is completely inconsistent with a stabbing.

To take this a step further, the autopsy suggests that the killers intent was
to slash the victims throat, since that is where the deep lacerations are. All
the oher wounds are superficial, defensive, and presumably collateral.

Cheri Batess killer could not have acted out of rage, because an enraged
killer would have stabbed the victim, particularly if he were making a frontal
attack. If the killer had somehow gotten behind the victim, it would have been
much more difficult for the victim to yank his watch off and pull his hair out.
And, while the petechial hemorrhaging is consistent with some sort of headlock
maneuver, one would expect the victims neck to be heavily bruised if she had
been choked to the point where the subcutaneous skin of the forehead showed
hemorrhaging; the medical examiner does not note any such bruising.

The medical examiner raises the possibility that Cheri Bates fainted out of
fear of the sudden attack, but that scenario is ruled out by the rather
dramatic evidence of a struggle.  And if she fainted, she probably didn't come
to in time to scream.

If Cheri Bates was assaulted by a single killer, one has to wonder why she
wasnt stabbed, and why she didnt run away, since the absence of bruising on
her neck and arms tells us her killer didnt hold her with one hand and slash
with the other.

The Cheri Bates homicide more closely resembles a cold-blooded execution than
it does a hot-blooded messy murder. It was quick, efficient, and likely
involved two assailants, one in front and one behind. The man in front held a
gun on her, the second man stepped in behind her and immediately began slashing
her throat as the first man ducked and wrapped his arms around her to keep her
from struggling or fleeing. The hemorrhaging to the forehead was caused by the
intense struggle. Once she was subdued, they lowered her to the ground and
dropped the watch a few feet away. One of them, most likely the one in front,
was scratched and had tufts of hair pulled out. Its conceivable that, since a
young man with a beard was seen inside the library and then did not return for
the reenactment, that the hairs stuck to Cheris palm in blood were actually
from his beard rather than the top of his head.

The murder could not have happened the way The Confession Letter says it did.
Cheri Bates was not choked and could not have been, since the medical examiner
noted no hemorrhaging in the eyes and her throat was not bruised. She was not
stabbed, and no broken blade was found either inside her body or on the ground.

Its fair to say that the Cheri Bates case is the most misunderstood murder in
the history of homicides, and most of the misunderstanding stems from the
public acceptance of the account given in The Confession Letter.

Its amazing, isnt it?

Zodiac hobbyists arent sure The Confession Letter was written by her killer.

They arent sure The Confession Letter was written by the Zodiac.

They arent sure the victim was killed by the Zodiac.

But they are ABSOLUTELY SURE of one thing: The Confession Letter is 100%
accurate.

That version is in conflict with the eyewitness accounts, with what the
victims friends and fiance have said about her, with what the victims stomach
contents tell us, with what the victims injuries tell us, and with what the
crime scene tells us.

It's the one thing about the Zodiac case I'll admit I don't understand.

Maybe I should ask ZKF?

Oh well.  I will be posting further insights on the case shortly.

ZKF, not so much.
