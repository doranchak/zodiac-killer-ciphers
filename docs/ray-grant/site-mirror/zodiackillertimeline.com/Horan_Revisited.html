					<div class="sf_pagetitle" ><div style="display:block;" ><h1>Horan Revisited</h1></div></div><div class="sf_content" ><div class="LayoutContainer" style="display:block;" ><div><div style="display:block;overflow:hidden;" ><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I will be posting more material onto <b>Riverside Timeline A</b> in the next day or so, this time dealing with some of the other suspects and story lines in the Cheri Bates murder.  I appreciate Mike Kelleher&#8217;s comments about what I&#8217;ve put up so far, and I think he has the right idea: if the Zodiac online community can&#8217;t agree on theories, maybe we can at least do what the Zodiologists website has done and come to certain basic conclusions based on analysis of the facts.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ve become a bit ticked-off that Thomas Horan is now taking pot-shots at individuals, particularly people like Morf13 and Tracers who have gone out of their way to keep the Zodiac case discourse civil.  Name-calling is usually not indicative of confidence in one&#8217;s ideas.  <br />
<br />
I've noticed that Horan doesn't want to take up the issues with his theory that I cited last April over at ZKF, and then again recently on <b>Horan Timeline</b> on this website.  I've been checking his Twitter account for the past week or so, and not a peep out of him about me, even though he's attacking everyone else.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ve been reading the comments section of the article on Horan&#8217;s book at Michael Cole&#8217;s website, <a href="http://www.zodiacrevisited.com/">ZodiacRevisited.com</a>., which right now is where the action is on the Zodiac case.  I will quote Horan&#8217;s comments in <b>bold</b> and then comment:<br />
<br />
<b>One large piece of Stine&#8217;s shirt is still missing. That one was probably torn off by the shooter, for whatever reason.</b><br />
<br />
"For whatever reason"--why on Earth would the shooter tear off a piece of Stine&#8217;s shirt, if not to be able to prove that The Writer was also The Killer later on?<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/803c959a8c211eb00345f88133adf86a.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<br />
The problem Horan has with the torn shirt is that he has to explain why the picture at the morgue already shows the back of the shirt missing, and why the picture of the body in the front seat shows his stomach.  Why would the victim&#8217;s stomach be showing if the killer didn&#8217;t pull out his shirt after shooting him?  Was Paul Stine driving around San Francisco&#8217;s Theatre District with his shirt pulled out and his stomach exposed?<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/30ce01627ed563b52eae1f0f5adb9ca1.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<br />
So Horan has to say, &#8220;Well, the killer tore off a piece of the shirt (for whatever reason), AND THEN The Writer&#8217;s accomplice (cop, morgue steward, anonymous morgue employee, medical examiner) tore off ANOTHER piece so The Writer could then mail parts of it with his letters.&#8221;<br />
<br />
<b>Unfortunately, no one at SFPD seems to have noticed any pieces missing until the second piece started showing up in &#8220;Zodiac&#8221; latters. This second swatch, a narrow strip which was quite clearly torn off after the first one, was returned, in two pieces, one mailed to Belli, the other to the Examiner/Chronicle. No piece of that swatch is missing; the whole thing was mailed in two letters.</b><br />
<br />
However many pieces of the shirt were torn off, there&#8217;s no way of telling what the time sequence would have been.  We know the killer must have torn the shirt because the victim&#8217;s stomach was showing.  So Horan wants us to believe that, if two swatches were torn off, they must have been torn off by two different people.  But that doesn&#8217;t follow.  The killer may have torn a large piece off the back of the shirt, and noted that there was a loose piece still connected to the shirt, and torn that piece off as well.  <br />
<br />
<b>It&#8217;s not just that there are two distinctly different tears. The second, narrow strip has unmistakable bloodstains which show that the second strip of cloth was torn off AFTER the body had been rolled over onto the seat by Dousette, the ambulance steward. These stains (the technical term is &#8220;blot&#8221;) are identical to the stains on the rest of the shirt.<br />
</b><br />
We don&#8217;t know exactly what the killer did with the body.  Horan needs that second strip to have been torn by someone other than the killer, so he assumes Doucette was the only one who could have moved it.<br />
<br />
<b>They do not show any signs of this strip of cloth having been used to wipe any surface, but of course, that alone doesn&#8217;t prove much, since the story of the killer wiping down the cab is an exaggeration by Graysmith, and not what the witnesses actually reported at the time. But the second tear is glaringly obvious, and so is the pattern of blood stains.</b><br />
<br />
This assumes that the shirt is what the killer would have used to wipe down the cab, and we don&#8217;t know that.  He might have done it with his handkerchief.<br />
<br />
A passenger shoots a cabbie in the head, killing him instantly.  He gets into the front seat of the cab and hacks off a piece of the cabbie&#8217;s shirt.  He risks his own freedom to do that, obviously.  Two days later, the newspaper receives a letter claiming credit for the murder and containing a swatch of the shirt.<br />
<br />
Thomas Horan admits that the killer hacked off a piece of the shirt, because photos of the body show that the victim&#8217;s shirt has been pulled out, exposing his stomach.<br />
<br />
But, Horan insists, the killer isn&#8217;t the one who sent the swatch of shirt with the letter.  A SECOND individual whom Horan conjured up out of whole cloth (get it: &#8220;whole cloth&#8221;?) made a SECOND tear in the shirt some time afterward, and what PROVES this is that there were TWO DISTINCT TEARS (which could not possibly have been made by the same person) and a different bloodstain pattern from the first piece (never mind that the first piece hasn&#8217;t come to light yet).<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/a6be5da2c39edc05f5c07693a2245ddd.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">
<br />
That isn&#8217;t Argument; that&#8217;s what&#8217;s known as Special Pleading. <br />
<br />
I<b>n short, the anwer to your question is yes&#8212;according to SFPD patrolman Pelisseti, who was first to arrive at the scene, Stine was lying facedown across the front bench seat with this head resting on the floorboard, passenger door closed. This makes sense, since the cockamamie theory that the shooter cradled Stine&#8217;s head in his lap makes very little sense. The actual witnesses reported no such thing. They did not, as is commonly believed, have a very clear view of the scene, and could not see into the passenger side of the cab at all. So the shooter most likely leaned over the body as any person would, and Pelisseti&#8217;s report would appear to confirm that.</b><br />
<br />
I know Horan has an extensive academic resume, so I&#8217;ll just assume he has a degree in Cockamamie Theories.  The killer would have had to have done more than &#8220;lean over the body&#8221; to pull his shirt out and hack half the back of it off.  Bodies are heavy and the front seats of cabs aren&#8217;t particularly roomy.  At some point the killer would have had to wield the body in some way, however it was done.<br />
<br />
<b>The crime scene photos taken by SFPD show Stine on his back, his arms hanging out of the open passenger door. Dousette was the first to roll Stine over onto his back to check for vital signs, etc. When the photographs were taken, Stine&#8217;s jacket and shirt were pulled up partway over his head, almost as if someone had tried to remove them. The shooter may have done this while tearing off the large, still-missing rectangle of cloth from the striped shirt. Dousette may have done it while checking for possible, further gunshot wounds and so forth.</b><br />
<br />
Armond Pelissetti says, in the <b>Zodiac</b> Director&#8217;s Cut DVD, that he was &#8220;99-point-9 certain&#8221; that Paul Stine was dead when he first saw him, from the position of the body in the front seat and the amount of blood.  Pelissetti was a first responder; Doucette was a morgue steward, not an ambulance attendant.  I think it&#8217;s fair to say that Doucette&#8217;s rolling of the body and examination were perfunctory, as these things go.  It&#8217;s doubtful that a morgue steward would move a body around much before the detectives got there.      <br />
<br />
<b>Either way, the upper portions of the shirt clearly show that the jacket protected that part of the shirt from picking up, or &#8220;blotting,&#8221; pools of blood from the seat. So does the second strip of shirt, that was mailed in two pieces in two Zodiac letters. Some of the stains are contiguous, that is, shared across, both the shirt and the second strip, indicating the stains were blotted at the same time. Lastly, the second strip of shirt fails to show any signs of having been used to &#8220;wipe down&#8221; the cab, which, again, may not have actually happened, even with the first piece of shirt. Lastly, the shirt, and the second strip of shirt, clearly show that the second strip of shirt could not have been torn off first&#8212;it could only have been torn off after the first piece. It could not have been torn off OF the first piece, as the second tear is plainly visible on the shirt itself (my book goes into more detail on all this.) And lastly, the blots show it was torn off AFTER the body had been rolled onto the seat.  All of this plainly visible to the naked eye. Under the microscope . . . , well, read the book.<br />
<br />
</b>No, thanks.<br />
<br />
I assume Thomas Horan is a professor of Forensic Alchemy, since he&#8217;s trying so hard to blind us with science.  Paul Stine was shot in the head.  As Dave Toschi noted at the crime scene, he &#8220;bled profusely&#8221;.  Linking the blotting pattern of blood on the shirt to the movement of the body on the seat is a bit much, under the circumstances.  We know the killer tore the first piece off.  He probably tore the second piece off, too.  Note that Horan makes sure that the critical moment is when Doucette rolls the body . . . not when the killer does the same thing. <br />
<br />
<b>That is, there are distinct &#8220;blots&#8221; (as opposed to drips&#8212;and yes, there is a way to tell the difference, but even more importantly, they are identical to, and in some cases, contiguous with, blots on the rest of the back of the shirt) on the strip of shirt in question, but no smears. In addition to trying to explain all this in words, I will be making some short videos about the shirt and possibly a LHR shooting reconstruction. So far as publishing photos of the shirt, that is another one of those legal questions I still need a couple of months to get consensus on.</b><br />
<br />
Blood drips, blots, and arterial spray are difficult enough to differentiate in a room of a house by forensic professionals.  When a rank amateur like Horan with an axe to grind tries to do it in the dark, cramped quarters of a cab&#8217;s front seat, with the condition of the victim&#8217;s body being initially compromised by the killer cutting his clothing, and the morgue steward then moving the body back from its initial resting place, I just hope the accompanying video is VERY short.  I&#8217;m not going to watch it, I just hate to see Horan waste any more of his life on this.<br />
<br />
<b>1. Speculation is the hallmark of this entire mythos. So I don&#8217;t do it. I only consider facts. </b><br />
<br />
The killer cut the victim&#8217;s shirt after the murder but was not the one who sent pieces of it to the newspapers.  Some SECOND person cut the shirt, and then a THIRD person sent the cut piece to the newspapers.<br />
<br />
You&#8217;re right.  That can&#8217;t be speculation, because no one would ever believe it.<br />
<br />
<b>2. According to the letters themselves, the motive for writing the letters was to convince the public&#8212;not the police, who immediately saw the letters were a hoax&#8212;that a cult loony had murdered David and Betty Lou. For reasons not entirely clear, VPD made a BIG deal out of that first prank call, even though, again, anyone involved in the case knew first-hand it was also a prank. NCSO also made a big deal out the second prank call. Interestingly, neither Rust nor Lonergan seem to have swallowed the bait, only Narlow and Lundblab. That&#8217;s one of many good reasons detectives always work in pairs, never alone.</b><br />
<br />
Apparently prank callers and letter hoaxers also work in pairs, though completely independent of each other.  If there were similar prank calls in Vallejo and Napa in that general time period, the police haven&#8217;t mentioned them.  <br />
<br />
<b>The murder of Jensen and Faraday was not &#8220;unsolved.&#8221; David Wally Ott and his gang look pretty guilty, conviction or no.</b><br />
<br />
Can't argue with that logic.&nbsp; If I&#8217;m ever up on a murder rap, I hope I don&#8217;t see Mr. Horan in the jury box!<br />
<br />
<b>IF by &#8220;original killer&#8221; you mean the junkie who accidentally shot Stine when the worn-out, hair-trigger 5 dollar &#8220;gun&#8221; he bought at the pawn shop went off in his hand when Stine breathed funny, then, yes.<br />
</b><br />
And, as any junkie would, he then got into the front seat of the cab and hacked off the back of Paul Stine&#8217;s shirt.  See, even though the shooting was accidental, he still wanted a souvenir.<br />
<br />
Even the morgue professionals who handled Stine&#8217;s shirt would not have assumed that the killer hacked it off.  They would have thought the shirt&#8217;s condition incongruous, but would not likely have jumped to the immediate conclusion that the killer did it, since there&#8217;s no obvious motive for such an act.<br />
<br />
If a SECOND person cut Stine&#8217;s shirt, who would it have been?<br />
<br />
Someone at the morgue?<br />
<br />
If The Writer had an accomplice at the morgue, why weren&#8217;t all the murders he wrote about in San Francisco?<br />
<br />
I hope I don&#8217;t sound crass if I compare two other serial killers.  Ted Bundy operated under a disadvantage that wasn&#8217;t shared by The Green River Killer.  Bundy&#8217;s victims were innocent young women whose murders made headlines and led to feature stories in the newspapers.  Gary Ridgway&#8217;s victims were almost all prostitutes or runaways, people who didn&#8217;t have detailed backstories.<br />
<br />
Another way of saying this is that Bundy&#8217;s victims were of a type whose murders would be individually investigated, even if law enforcement was unaware that they were connected.  Granted, there was a Green River Killer Task Force in Washington state, and the effect of Bundy&#8217;s homicides was diffused somewhat by his changing jurisdictions (Seattle Ted became Utah Ted and Colorado Ted, for example), but still, the demographics of victims makes a difference.<br />
<br />
One could make a fairly strong case that the most publicized victims in any serial murder case, as a group, are the Zodiac victims, particularly if you include Cheri Bates, Donna Lass, and Joan Webster.<br />
<br />
The Writer of the Zodiac letters went to a lot of trouble to wage his campaign, making up ciphers and drawing diagrams of bombs.  If his letters were actually hoaxes, and nothing really connected the crimes to one another, then it was critical that the murders he claimed remained unsolved.<br />
<br />
So why would that Zodiac Hoaxer pick two of the most notorious murder events in the history of Vallejo&#8212;Lake Herman Road and Blue Rock Springs&#8212;when, by Horan&#8217;s own admission, The Writer had an accomplice at the San Francisco morgue?<br />
<br />
Why wouldn&#8217;t the accomplice wait for a John or Jane Doe murder right there in the big city, let a few weeks pass to be confident it wouldn&#8217;t be solved, and then claim THAT murder as his own?<br />
<br />
Thomas Horan keeps talking about how incompetent SFPD was.  Well then, why wouldn&#8217;t the hoaxer have taken advantage of that, instead of claiming notorious murders in three other jurisdictions (Solano County, Vallejo, Napa)?<br />
<br />
And why on Earth would The Writer have The Accomplice cut the Stine shirt for him, and then mail a swatch of that shirt less than 48 hours after the murder?<br />
<br />
What if the real killer pulls another hold-up that Monday night, and the 5 dollar &#8220;gun&#8221; he uses is found on his person and traced back to the Presidio Heights job?<br />
<br />
Junkies are impatient; they won&#8217;t wait while you construct your next cipher.<br />
<br />
If I may paraphrase Carl Sagan, <b>The Great Zodiac Hoax of 1969</b> is to serial murder investigations what <b><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Worlds_in_Collision">Worlds In Collision</a></b> is to astronomy.<br />
