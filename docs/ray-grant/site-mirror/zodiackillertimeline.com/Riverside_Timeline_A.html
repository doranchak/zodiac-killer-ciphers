<br />
Timeline B will cover what I think actually happened in Riverside.<br />
<br />
Timeline A will cover what clearly DIDN&#8217;T happen.<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB7OcOKwZ-s"><br />
</a><br />
In Errol Morris's non-fiction film, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dB7OcOKwZ-s">The Thin Blue Line</a>, the director uses recreations similar to those found on True Crime TV shows (such as America's Most Wanted) . . . but with one crucial difference.<br />
<br />
Errol Morris believes David Harris killed Officer Robert Wood.  But he never shows us that.  He shows us everything BUT that.<br />
<br />
The reenactments in <b>The Thin Blue Line</b> don't attempt to show the truth.<br />
<br />
Instead, they illustrate lies.<br />
<br />
They demonstrate things that DIDN'T happen.<br />
<br />
COULDN'T have happened.<br />
<br />
Couldn't POSSIBLY have happened.<br />
<br />
My intent, on this website, is to establish, by examining the timeline of each individual Zodiac murder, WHAT ACTUALLY HAPPENED.<br />
<br />
But, most of the time, I'll accomplish that by first showing what DIDN'T happen.<br />
<br />
What COULDN'T have happened.<br />
<br />
What couldn't POSSIBLY have happened.<br />
<br />
To paraphrase Sir Arthur Conan Doyle: Once one eliminates the IMPOSSIBLE, whatever remains, however improbable, MUST BE THE TRUTH.<br />
<br />
The truth in the Zodiac case is very hard to believe.<br />
<br />
That's why I have to eliminate everything else first.<br />
<br />
<b>Riverside, California<br />
Sunday, October 30, 1966</b><br />
<br />
<b>8am to 10am</b><br />
<br />
Cheri Bates attends mass at St. Catherine Church on Brockton with her father, Joseph Bates.  After mass, the two eat breakfast at Sandy&#8217;s Restaurant in The Hardman Center, around the corner from their house.  One acquaintance who sees Cheri at Sandy&#8217;s that morning is &#8220;Bob Barnett&#8221; (not his real name), who will be the chief suspect in her murder for almost 30 years.<br />
<br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><b><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">TIMEOUT: 9am</font></font></b><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
If I&#8217;m going to establish what DIDN&#8217;T happen that Sunday, eliminating the chief suspect in Cheri&#8217;s murder might be a good place to start.<br />
<br />
&#8220;Bob Barnett&#8221; is the stuff of legend&#8212;specifically, URBAN legend.<br />
<br />
If you made a pie chart of the alleged evidence against Barnett, the various sections of the pie might read Unsubstantiated Stories, Jailhouse Snitch Testimony, Things That Couldn&#8217;t Possibly Have Happened, Witness Accounts That Do Not Specifically Identify Barnett, Things That Are Patently Untrue, Attributes Cheri&#8217;s Killer Shares With Barnett and Thousands of Others, etc..<br />
<br />
Pie segments one could actually swallow?<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m still chewing on that one.  Bob Barnett was a suspect because Riverside PD needed a suspect, and they&#8217;d already eliminated everyone.  So they went back and took a fresh look at a non-suspect, with a little help from his friends.<br />
<br />
Captain Roy Conway of Vallejo PD told me, in 1991 or 1992, that he couldn&#8217;t take my theory seriously because I believed the Zodiac killed Cheri Bates, and Captain Conway knew Cheri Bates was killed by a local suspect.  He couldn&#8217;t tell me why he believed this, but he did say that if I knew what he knew, I&#8217;d agree with him.<br />
<br />
Thanks to Tom Voigt, I have since been able to look at Riverside PD&#8217;s circumstantial case against Bob Barnett.  I will comment on each aspect of this list in the order it was presented to me.   <br />
<br />
<b>1. Initially cleared of suspicion, Barnett became a prime suspect about 1968 when Riverside PD heard testimony of an informant who claimed Barnett had bragged about being responsible for the killing.  This informant was in jail when he came forward with the incriminating information about Barnett, but passed a polygraph test.  His story has remained consistent.</b><br />
<br />
The single most important phrase in that paragraph is the first four words, &#8220;Initially cleared of suspicion&#8221;.  What this means, in the context of the Bates investigation, is that Bob Barnett did NOT have scratches on his face and person in the immediate aftermath of the murder, that his scalp was not bloody, and that he was not otherwise marked in a manner that might suggest he had grappled with Cheri Bates.  It also means that his fingerprints did not match what was left on and in Cheri Bates&#8217;s VW.<br />
<br />
I want the reader to think about that for a moment.<br />
<br />
For three decades, the chief suspect in the Cheri Bates murder was someone who had already been excluded by forensic evidence taken from the crime scene.<br />
<br />
Therefore, Bob Barnett could not possibly have murdered Cheri Bates . . . unless you assume that more than one person was involved.  If Barnett wasn&#8217;t scratched-up and his fingerprints didn&#8217;t match the latents left at Cheri&#8217;s VW, then he essentially stood by and let his accomplice do the dirty work for him.  His accomplice pulled the wire from the engine and left his greasy prints, his accomplice got scratched-up in the struggle with the victim, and, as we found out when the mitochondrial DNA stuck to Cheri Bates&#8217;s palm in blood was compared with Bob Barnett&#8217;s, his accomplice got his hair pulled out.<br />
<br />
In the entire history of homicides, the Cheri Bates case is unique; a crime of rage in which the enraged person sits out the murder with his arms folded. <br />
<br />
<b>Barnett became a prime suspect about 1968</b><br />
<br />
Sorry, that&#8217;s wrong.  Riverside PD didn&#8217;t have prime suspect earlier than October 1969.  Read Chief Kinkead&#8217;s letter (October 20, 1969) to the Napa Sheriff&#8217;s Office, which was a follow-up to a phone conversation (October 17, 1969):<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.zodiackiller.com/RiversideMemo1.html">Riverside/Napa Memo</a><br />
<br />
If Riverside PD honestly believed Bob Barnett or any other local suspect was the killer, they would have mentioned that suspect, at least in passing, in the letter.  Instead, the chief points out the &#8220;numerous similarities&#8221; between the Riverside murder and that at Lake Berryessa, and pushed for a comparison of the latents from the Bates and Stine murders.<br />
<br />
<b>This informant was in jail when he came forward with the incriminating information about Barnett, but passed a polygraph test.  His story has remained consistent.</b><br />
<br />
Polygraph exams aren&#8217;t admissible in court.  Jailhouse snitches are notoriously unreliable.  Hearsay accounts featuring a single witness tend to be consistent, since only the accused himself can contradict them.    <br />
<br />
<b>2. Like Cheri, Barnett was a student at RCC during the fall of 1966.  In fact, Barnett and Cheri dated in the weeks before her death.  Barnett had also attended school with Cheri prior to RCC.  Barnett was mentioned several times in Cheri&#8217;s diary. (The diary is still in police custody.)</b><br />
<br />
Bob Barnett was in Cheri Bates&#8217;s class at Ramona High School and also attended RCC.  In a 2003 statement to Tom Voigt, Barnett insisted that he NEVER dated Cheri, and in fact dated Cheri&#8217;s friend and co-worker at Riverside National Bank, Donna.  Since Barnett was the boy friend of one of Cheri&#8217;s best friends, one of two women Cheri talked to on the phone on the last afternoon of her life, it seems natural that he would be mentioned at some point in Cheri&#8217;s diary.  Riverside PD hasn&#8217;t exactly been forthcoming about the contents of Cheri&#8217;s diary, which tends to make me think what was written there doesn&#8217;t back up their version of the relationship.  Granted, the contents of someone&#8217;s diary, in relation to the guilt or innocence of a suspect, would be hearsay testimony, but so is the rest of Riverside PD&#8217;s case against Barnett.   <br />
<br />
<b>3. The relationship between Barnett and Cheri soured after Cheri returned from San Francisco, where she had visited her steady boyfriend.  Cheri informed Barnett that she had accepted this boyfriend&#8217;s wedding proposal and that she and Barnett could no longer date. (This conversation with Barnett occurred less than a week before her murder.)<br />
</b>
<br />
Dennis Highland wasn&#8217;t Cheri&#8217;s steady boyfriend; he&#8217;d been her fianc&#233; for two years.  Cheri&#8217;s trip to San Francisco coincided with that of his parents; I don&#8217;t know that they traveled together, but it&#8217;s clear that the four of them intended to be together that weekend.  Cheri could not possibly have informed Barnett that she had accepted Highland&#8217;s proposal that weekend, since she had visited Highland in San Francisco that weekend WITH his parents.  Barnett could not have been dating Cheri Bates since he was dating Cheri&#8217;s girl friend, Donna, and women are notoriously possessive about the guys they&#8217;re dating, even among friends.<br />
<br />
Let me just interject at this point, that if Riverside PD&#8217;s version of these events sounds completely ludicrous, that&#8217;s because it is.  <br />
<br />
<b>4. Barnett and Cheri engaged in a very public argument on the RCC campus just days before her murder.  During the argument, Barnett allegedly slapped Cheri.  A passerby heard Barnett say, &#8220;Have you changed your mind yet?&#8221;</b><br />
<br />
I mentioned The Urban Legend of Bob Barnett earlier; you wonder where stories like this come from.  Barnett has denied having any argument in public and has denied slapping anyone.  Nothing in the original reporting of the crime mentions this incident or anything similar to it.  If students at Riverside City College had witnessed a &#8220;very public&#8221; argument between Cheri Bates and Bob Barnett, and witnessed Barnett slapping her, and then, just days later, Bates was murdered . . . wouldn&#8217;t RCC have expelled him?  The murder was the most notorious in the history of Riverside, let alone RCC.  If there was anything at all to the story, wouldn&#8217;t RCC have held some sort of hearing and been proactive about punishing Barnett?  By all accounts, Cheri Bates was one of the most popular students at RCC; if she had been struck in public, wouldn&#8217;t there have been an outcry to deal with her assailant?  And if that hadn&#8217;t happened immediately, for whatever reason, wouldn&#8217;t there have been one days later, in the wake of her murder?<br />
<br />
<b>5. The evening Cheri was killed, Barnett was playing basketball with his buddies.  Cheri called him for reasons unknown and Barnett immediately left the game, saying, &#8220;That bitch is going to the library.&#8221;</b><br />
<br />
If Barnett was playing basketball, how could Cheri have called him?  I was 15 years old in 1966, and take my word for it, we didn&#8217;t have cell phones.  Did he have a basketball court inside his house?  I remember Chicago Bulls superstar Scottie Pippen being interviewed from the court which had been added onto his mansion, but somehow I doubt Bob Barnett had a similar set-up.<br />
<br />
Cheri could not logically have called Barnett after 6:15pm, since no one had reported seeing or otherwise hearing from Cheri after she was sighted driving up the alley by the March Air Force Base man a block from RCC at 6:15pm.  If Cheri had called Barnett after that time, Riverside PD would have been all over that call.  But no such call is mentioned in any of the news accounts after the murder.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates and Bob Barnett weren&#8217;t romantically involved.  Bob Barnett says it, Dennis Highland has said it, and no one other than Riverside PD has suggested it.  The only logical reason I can think of for Cheri Bates to call Bob Barnett that afternoon would have been in connection with looking for her missing term paper bibliography.  At approximately 5:30pm that afternoon, Cheri Bates called her friend and co-worker at Riverside National Bank, Donna, and asked if she&#8217;d seen the bibliography laying around anywhere.  Donna said she hadn&#8217;t.  It&#8217;s conceivable, though barely, that Donna brought up the possibility that Barnett had seen the bibliography, since Barnett was Donna&#8217;s boy friend and presumably spent lots of time in her company.  Cheri would ordinarily not have known Barnett&#8217;s phone number, but Donna could have given it to her under those circumstances.  Cheri might then have called Barnett to ask if he&#8217;d seen the bibliography; again, keep in mind that Barnett told Tom Voigt there was no ill will between Cheri and himself.<br />
<br />
Again, I don&#8217;t see how Cheri could have called Barnett if he was already playing basketball at an outside court or gymnasium.  If Cheri called Barnett at his house just prior to his leaving to play basketball with his buddies, he might have been very exasperated at the request, and said something along the lines of his quote above, something he wouldn&#8217;t actually say to her face.  Men say things like that when they don&#8217;t want to look like a wimp for doing a girl friend&#8217;s friend a small favor.<br />
<br />
Again, my point is, melodramatic as it sounds, the incident at, or more likely prior to, the basketball game, may have been entirely innocent and not nearly as menacing as it sounds.  The only difficulty I see with the timeline is that Cheri Bates almost certainly called Donna from a pay phone outside the library at 5:30pm, which means she was already AT the library when she called, but Barnett wouldn&#8217;t have known that.  It&#8217;s also possible she called Barnett from her house circa 6pm or so, after not being able to find the bibliography back at her house, and told him she&#8217;d be at The RCC Library that evening if he managed to find it.<br />
<br />
This sidebar is a bit convoluted, perhaps, but it demonstrates how critical it is to place events in a timeline.<br />
<br />
CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING.       <br />
<br />
<b>6. At about 9:30 o&#8217;clock the night of the murder, a female student passed a man standing in the alley where Cheri would be attacked just minutes later.  Although they didn&#8217;t know each other, the female student and unknown male said &#8220;hi&#8221; to each other.  The stranger was standing in the shadows.  It was later determined that from his vantage point he could have easily watched Cheri&#8217;s VW Bug while she was in the library.  Several years later, RPD showed the female student a photo lineup which contained Barnett&#8217;s picture.  Although she could not identify anyone in the lineup, she initially had described clothing on the unknown male that matched what Barnett was wearing the night of the murder.</b><br />
<br />
9:30pm is a full half-hour AFTER the library closed.  If The Confession Letter is to be believed, Cheri&#8217;s killer waited INSIDE the library and then followed her out after about two minutes.  So how could he have been standing in the alley at 9:30pm?  And if Barnett was standing in the alley at 9:30pm, he couldn&#8217;t have been with Cheri Bates at her car, trying to get it to start. <br />
<br />
<b>7. At about 1:30am on Oct. 31, only hours after Cheri was murdered, neighbors witnessed TWO men in the area of the crime scene with flashlights.  The men appeared to be searching for something.  After about 15 minutes, they left.  This info led police to believe Barnett had an accomplice.</b><br />
<br />
Just to remind the reader, Bob Barnett is the prime suspect in the Cheri Bates murder who was not scratched-up or otherwise marked when he was initially interviewed, hadn&#8217;t had his hair pulled out, and whose fingerprints did not match those left at the victim&#8217;s car.  None of the forensic evidence pointed to him, he had no apparent motive, and he was not positively identified by the only eyewitness in the area an hour prior to the attack.<br />
<br />
But, since two men were seen in the general area of the crime scene at 1:30am that morning,  wielding flashlights, this leads Riverside PD to the conclusion that Bob Barnett had an accomplice.<br />
<br />
In police procedural terms, that&#8217;s called Getting Two For The Price of NONE!<br />
<br />
<b>8. Barnett&#8217;s best friend failed a polygraph test.  (Barnett later took a polygraph test on the advice of his lawyer.  He cooperated at first, but when the tough questions were asked he simply refused to answer.  The polygraph examiner finally said, &#8220;Get him the #*@ out of here.&#8221;)<br />
</b>
<br />
I hate to keep beating this dead horse, but polygraph exams are not admissible in a court of law.  Riverside PD&#8217;s circumstantial case against Bob Barnett consists almost entirely of hearsay testimony from extremely unreliable witnesses, backed up by an assortment of polygraph results that prove absolutely nothing.<br />
<br />
<b>9. In spite of promising circumstances, the case against Bob Barnett was at an impasse.</b><br />
<br />
Now THERE&#8217;S a news flash!<br />
<br />
<b>10. In the early 1990s, Barnett&#8217;s former best friend finally admitted that he HAD seen Barnett the morning of October 31, 1966.  He had &#8220;accidentally&#8221; run into Barnett about 2:30am at a restaurant called &#8220;The Green Turtle&#8221;.  Barnett asked him for a ride to RCC in order to look for something he had misplaced.</b><br />
<br />
The suggestion here is that Bob Barnett had murdered Cheri Bates and then noticed, sometime later that night, that his Timex watch was missing.  Again, none of this makes any sense at all.  The neighbors who said they saw two men with flashlights in the area saw them circa 1:30am, not after 2:30am.  If Barnett had been searching for his Timex at 1:30am, why would he need a ride to RCC an hour later?  And how could two men spend 15 minutes at the crime scene with flashlights and NOT find the Timex, which was ten feet from the body, a black-banded watch laying on bright white gravel?  We know they didn&#8217;t find it because the police did that morning.  The watch face was also speckled with white latex paint.  Riverside PD would certainly have checked Barnett out for any painting activity in the days prior to the murder.  <br />
<br />
<b>11. To police, Barnett&#8217;s friend would not admit that he had any knowledge that a crime had occurred.  He eventually took a polygraph test, which indicated he was truthful EXCEPT regarding questions that might implicate HIMSELF in Cheri&#8217;s murder.  Another friend of Barnett&#8217;s came forward and admitted that a sobbing Barnett had claimed, early on the morning of Oct. 31, 1966, that he had &#8220;snuffed Cheri&#8221;.  This friend also passed a polygraph.</b><br />
<br />
Barnett&#8217;s friends all sound like characters from a Martin Scorsese movie, except for their willingness to cooperate with law enforcement.  I suppose it&#8217;s possible that Barnett was genuinely upset that morning to hear about Cheri Bates&#8217;s death, and that his friend mistook his sorrow for remorse.  In any case, nothing ties Barnett to the crime scene.<br />
<br />
Hearsay + Polygraph &#8800; The Truth<br />
<br />
<b>12. Although Barnett had no military affiliation, his sister worked at Norton Air Force Base at the time of the Bates murder.  That could explain the origin of the military shoeprints and Timex watch found at the scene.  While the watch was determined to have been initially sold at a military installation, exactly WHICH installation remains a mystery.  (Barnett&#8217;s sister is not suspected of being an accomplice.  The assumption is that she might have given the shoes and watch to Barnett as a gift.  Barnett&#8217;s family members did admit he had a watch similar to the one recovered at the crime scene and that they never saw it again after Bates was killed.)</b><br />
<br />
This is about as vague as an investigative link gets.  Police may have had shoe prints, but they didn&#8217;t have shoes.  In any case, both the shoes and the Timex watch were common items.  If a vendor bought lots of surplus military items and resold them, there&#8217;s your link.  The proximity of March Air Force Base led police to suspect a military man may have committed the murder, just as they suspected fellow RCC students.<br />
<br />
<b>13. When Cheri&#8217;s body was found, two or three strands of hair were recovered from a clot of blood and tissue in the palm of her hand.  At the time, the technology would only show that the hair, blood, and tissue were that of a white male with sandy-blond hair.  Barnett is a white male and, at the time, had sandy-blond hair.  (Tissue was also recovered from under Cheri&#8217;s fingernails, but was too decomposed to gather DNA from by the time it was attempted in the early 1990s.)</b><br />
<br />
Police initially eliminated Barnett because his face wasn&#8217;t marked and his fingerprints didn&#8217;t match the latents.  He also wasn&#8217;t identified by any witness, and had no motive until Riverside PD manufactured one for him.<br />
<br />
<b>14. In December 1998, information was developed that Barnett was returning to the Riverside area for Christmas.  RPD managed to get a warrant and met Barnett upon his arrival at Ontario Airport.  RPD took skin, saliva, hair and other samples from Barnett, which were then sent for DNA analysis to the FBI Laboratory in Quantico, Va.  Barnett was described as having displayed a passive, &#8220;What took you so long?&#8221; type of attitude with detectives, sending their suspicions of his guilt soaring even higher.  UPDATE: The DNA results were a conclusive non-match.</b><br />
<br />
The reader may well be asking the obvious question:<br />
<br />
Why would Riverside PD have spend the better part of three decades pursuing a suspect who had already been eliminated in the immediate aftermath of the murder, and whose circumstantial case against him was so weak?<br />
<br />
The answer goes back to that Kinkead memo of October 20, 1969.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.zodiackiller.com/RiversideMemo1.html">Riverside/Napa Memo</a><br />
<br />
When the FBI lab checked the Riverside latents against what the Zodiac killer left on Paul Stine&#8217;s cab in Presidio Heights, it concluded they were two different sets of prints, from two separate suspects.<br />
<br />
Here is Riverside PD Detective Steve Shumway in 2004, speaking once again with Tom Voigt of ZodiacKiller.com:<br />
<br />
<b>"There are two things for sure you can share with your many readers: There was a murderer who called himself the Zodiac, and there was the murderer who killed Cheri. They are two different people."</b><br />
<br />
Well, with all due respect, Detective Shumway, that&#8217;s a conclusion not supported by the evidence.  What you actually mean to say is:<br />
<br />
<b>&#8220;The latents left in Presidio Heights by the Zodiac killer, and the latents left at Cheri Bates&#8217;s VW, presumably by her killer . . . ARE TWO DIFFERENT SETS OF PRINTS.&#8221;</b><br />
<br />
Note that this is consistent with the actions of Riverside PD.  Almost immediately after the Kinkead letter to Napa, which suggested the comparison of the latents on file at the FBI, Riverside PD did an abrupt about-face, dropped its interest in any Zodiac link, and began pursuing Bob Barnett as a suspect.<br />
<br />
If Cheri Bates was killed by one person, that eliminates the Zodiac.  But, as I&#8217;ve already noted, Cheri Bates&#8217;s autopsy suggests strongly that she was killed by TWO people.  So if the Zodiac killed Cheri Bates . . . the Zodiac is at least two people.<br />
<br />
The one thing for sure I can share with my many readers, especially the Zodiac website administrators and Zodiac message board posters who keep bringing his name up as if he had ever been a viable suspect:<br />
<br />
Bob Barnett was NOT involved in any way with the Cheri Bates homicide.<br />
<br />
After 45+ years . . . GET OVER IT!  </font></div></div></div></div>
