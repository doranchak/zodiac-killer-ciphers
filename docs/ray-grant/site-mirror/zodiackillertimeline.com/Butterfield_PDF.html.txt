I was looking through Mike Butterfield's 2007 PDF, ZZooddiiaacc DDeeaatthh MMaacchhiinnee,, which
Tom emailed to me about a year ago.  I'm going to write a detailed timeline of
the Cheri Bates murder in the next few days, which will be more formalized and
concise than what I've put up on the website so far, but I was curious to see
what Butterfield's own timeline looked like.

Butterfield's timeline for Riverside is largely just a retyping of what's in
Graysmith's ZZooddiiaacc.  There are also numerous factual errors, just careless
mistakes of the type Butterfield would gloat over with gleeful insults if
someone else had made them.  He does comment on the autopsy, however:

While I'm inclined to agree with Butterfield on this, that the petechiae would
seem to point to the victim having been choked at some stage of the attack,
it's interesting that the surgeon neither mentioned them in his comments
section, nor noted the presence of discolored skin in the neck area.

If Cheri Bates was choked at some point, as the petechiae might suggest and as
The Confession Letter attests, it would seem to offer two different
descriptions of her attacker:

1, Either her attacker was exceptionally strong, in the sense that he could
choke a very young, very athletic victim with one hand while slashing her with
a knife held in his other hand, all the while keeping her from running away; OR

2, she was attacked by two men, one from the front and one behind (which more
easily explains the absence of flight).

The absence of discoloration to the neck argues against the first scenario;
however expert her killer may have been, if he was strong enough to have held
her with one hand by the throat, the victim's neck would have been heavily
bruised.

A more likely explanation for the burst blood vessels would be the victim
having to grapple with two men, one of whom held her (likely with her mouth
covered) while the other slashed her throat (most likely from behind).  It's
also the only scenario that makes sense of the concentration of wounds in her
throat.  Since all her other wounds were superficial, and since we know that
she scratched the hair out of one of her assailants (and presumably pulled his
watch off), the chances of a single killer being able to slash her throat so
accurately in a pitch dark alley with an uncooperative victim would seem pretty
slim.

Again, I don't see how an individual killer manages to inflict mortal wounds in
ONE area of the victim's body and superficial wounds everywhere else.  I don't
see how an individual killer restrains a victim and cuts her throat almost
clear through without causing significant damage anywhere else, particularly
under those circumstances and with that victim.

The petechiael hemorrhaging does suggest Cheri Bates was restrained at some
point . . . but probably not by one killer.
