Im watching the Steelers game on TV as I type this, so rather than attempt any
in-depth analysis of the Riverside murder, I thought Id address some points
made on _Z_o_d_i_a_c_R_e_v_i_s_i_t_e_d_._c_o_m, mostly by Morf13. The reason for my doing this
should become clear as I do it.

A quick word: Morf13 is a good guy. About 3 years ago he got fed up with all
the sniping in the Zodiac online community and decided to start up his own
message board, with the help of AK Wilks, which would concentrate on discussing
the case itself and dispense with all the personal stuff. Im not really a
message board person, which is why Ive chosen to respond to any points made by
others on my own websites. My experience in August 2011 of having 4-
5 consecutive posts deleted by ZK.com moderators, mostly because they were too
long, was pretty much the last straw, though granted Ive posted a few times
on Toms board in the year or so since. Morf13s main criticism of me has been
that I tend to hijack threads, which may have some validity since people like
The Foreigner and Tracers have said the same thing, but I had to laugh when I
saw Morf13 posting lengthy comments on ZodiacRevisited.com articles, including
one devoted to ZKT. I guess whether you think youre being hijacked or not
depends entirely on which ultimate destination you had in mind.

Heres the initial comment he posted on Mike Kellehers article about my ZKT
site:

Morf13 posts under the Comments section of an article about my Riverside
Timeline, he types exactly one vague sentence about that article, more than
half of which is an emphatic renunciation of my work in general, and then
abruptly launches into his own speculation about the Bates case which goes on
and on in a very long post. Would it be fair to call that a hijacking of the
thread?

Lets take a look at slightly more recent comments on the same topic by Morf13.

Well, I am certainly not endorsing the actions of Riverside PD, vis-à-vis the
decision to make Bob Barnett the chief suspect after the fingerprints from
Riverside and those from Presidio Heights were found not to match (see the
October 20, 1969 memo to Napa SO by Chief Kinkead).

But accusing Riverside PD of being stubborn and reckless and jeopardizing the
chances of the Bates case ever being solved is one of those pot/kettle, glass
house/stones, bramble/pomegranate tree situations.

Morf, listen carefully: 65 witnesses inside and outside The RCC Library that
night never saw Cheri Bates, her stomach contents tell us she was abducted
earlier in the evening, the condition her car was left in tells us that she
didnt leave it that way voluntarily, the actions The Confession Letter claims
she took are completely uncharacteristic of her, at least according to her
friends and fiance, and the autopsy report of the wounds on her body tells us
she couldnt realistically have been assaulted by just one killer.

And yet, the one major Zodiac website administrator who refuses to use his real
name (as opposed to Mike Butterfield, Michael Cole, Howard Davis, Chris Farmer,
Ray Grant, Tom Voigt, and Chris Yarbrough) INSISTS upon speculating about what
Cheri Bates did AFTER she walked out of the library and found her car wouldnt
start.

Ive already listed the letters I believe were written by the Zodiac on the
TZMS website. Essentially, I believe all the Zodiac letters are authentic,
including The Hole Card and The SLA Card, with the exception of The April 1978
Letter (which was almost certainly written by Dave Toschi), and including all
three of the Riverside writings (The Desk Poem was not technically a letter,
since it was never sent through the mail).

But Ill concede that handwriting analysis, and for that matter, document
examination, appears to be an inexact science. As Ive said many times, and as
can be seen in my analysis of Zodiac letters in TZMS 1993 (mostly on TZMS 1993-
2), now posted on my TZMS website, the strongest reason to believe the Zodiac
letters were all written by the same entity is that all of them contain a
cryptographic undertext.

If you put those three shared characteristics between the Riverside
communications and The Bay Area Zodiac letters together: the general tone of
the messages, the handwriting similarity, and the cryptographic undertexts, and
add to them that the Zodiac acknowledged his riverside activity in a letter
from March 1971, and that virtually no other killers had written to the
newspapers prior to 1966, I really dont understand why some people still
believe Riverside wasnt the Zodiac.

Either Seagull or Tracers or Tahoe27 (I get those three mixed-up) put forth the
opinion that The Confession Letter contained an attitude toward women in
general that was much darker and more pathological than what was found in the
Zodiac letters. I wont argue with that as an impression, but I question how
much weight we can assign to it as categorically separating one letter writer
from another. I hate to keep harping on this, but I minored in Psych, and would
have double-majored in English Writing and Psych if Id taken the single-credit
Psych labs attached to each course (six of themI was 6 credits short of a
major). I had a significant amount of clinical experience as a student intern
(though that term wasnt commonly used back then), and I have to stress that
all the psychologizing that you see on Zodiac message boards (particularly on
ZKF, but you see it on all the Z boards) is just poking around in the dark. You
cant make anything approaching a clinical diagnosis without having a subject
to examine. Period. And it is generally a mistake to assume that real people
are as consistent as either fictional characters or pathological prototypes. If
they were, there might not be any serial killers or mass murderers, because
theyd stick out like sore thumbs while they were still in the developmental
stage. Preventing crime would be done along the lines of _M_i_n_o_r_i_t_y_ _R_e_p_o_r_t,
except that the predictors would be psychologists instead of psychics.

The opposite is true. The behavior of Riverside PD, which was enthusiastic
about the Zodiac link until after the comparison was made, tells us that the
latents left on Cheri Batess car did NOT match the prints taken in Presidio
Heights. In other words, if the Zodiac killed Cheri Bates, then the Zodiac is
at least two different people.

As I stated, the circumstantial case connecting the Riverside writings to the
Zodiac letters in The Bay Area is overwhelming. It appears to be the same
writer based on general characteristics (language, tone, handwriting, and the
primary motive of publicity for his crimes). There is also the absence of any
alternative hypothesis: if, as Tom Voigt has suggested, The Confession Letter
is a hoax, then it is an unusually elaborate hoax (two mailings, multiple
carbon copies, a postmark 30 days after the murder) with no apparent follow-up.
The hoaxer made ONE phone call shortly after the murder, sent ONE very long and
detailed typed letter a month later . . . and was never heard from again. Most
elaborate hoaxers keep writing_W_e_a_r_s_i_d_e_ _J_a_c_k, the _Y_o_r_k_s_h_i_r_e_ _R_i_p_p_e_rs
doppelganger, sent three letters and a cassette tape and also made phone calls
to the police.

If theres anything that absolutely jumps out at us about the Cheri Bates case,
its that the police had no leads. When one compares the amount of
investigative legwork that was done, and how much manpower was used, with what
the police actually went withthe Bob Barnett circumstantial case, which, in
hindsight, was nonexistentit tells us that they had ZERO local suspects.

That doesnt mean they didnt check out everyone in proximity to the victim,
like a stone dropped in a pond, starting with Cheri Bates and moving outward
concentrically. It means that, no matter how thorough their investigation
wasand the library reenactment tells us Riverside PDs due diligence was as
exhaustive as any local investigation of a co-ed murder has ever beenthey
didnt find anything.

Cheri Bates was killed by the Zodiac. The only reason to doubt that was the FBI
mismatch of fingerprints between Riverside and Presidio Heights, based on the
assumption that either Cheri Bates or Paul Stine was killed by a single
individual acting without an accomplice. But the wounds cited in the Cheri
Bates autopsy are consistent with at least two assailants working in tandem,
unless one assumes that the victim fainted, fell to the ground, and then
awakened in time to scream as her killer was cutting her throat.

Cheri Bates was 18 years old. If her killer was her age, hed have been 20 or
21 when the Zodiac events in The Bay Area took place. 21 is younger than any of
the estimates of the Zodiacs age.

Theres no EVIDENCE suggesting Cheri Bates went off to a dimly lighted area.

The eyewitnesses dont place her either in the library or on the street. Her
stomach contents suggest she was abducted for several hours prior to her death.
The condition her car was left in argues against her leaving it that way
voluntarily. Both Cheris friends and her fiance have said she was terrified of
the dark and would NEVER have walked down that alley voluntarily.

Additionally, the walk from her car to that alley was 75 yards. There were pay
phones closer than that from which she could call friends to pick her up, or
call her dad at the house of his friend, since shed have known who hed gone
to the beach with.

If Cheri Bates was killed by an individual, that individual would have had his
face scratched-up and tufts of hair pulled out. If the Timex watch was
legitimately pulled off by the victim, that would have taken a significant
amount of force, and we can thus be sure that an individual assailant would
have been noticeably disheveled in the immediate aftermath of the murder.

All the males in Cheris class at Ramona High School were checked out. All her
male classmates at RCC were checked out. The police had visual inspection of
face and hair to go by, fingerprints, and would have asked for alibis.
Additionally, all those so-called friends of Bob Barnett who tattled on him
could have been checked for the mitochondrial DNA after Barnett was cleared:
still no hits.

Cheri Bates was NOT killed by a local boy, Morf. Tear that one up.

Speaking of evidence, both the eyewitness accounts and the forensic facts argue
very strongly that the Bates murder was premeditated, cold-blooded, and that
the victim was NOT walking around under her own power just prior to her death.

In my opinion those 2 have already been cleared. If we start suspecting
everyone who moved from Riverside to northern California, thats a lot of
suspects to process. Any male Cheri would have associated with would have been
looked at very closely (scratches, fingerprints, hair, alibi) and eliminated.

Morfs intent here is to suggest that some local boy that Cheri Bates felt
comfortable with walked down a dark alley with her and then suddenly committed
a very hot-blooded murder. Eventually he moved to northern California and
turned into the Zodiac.

Well, thats nice, but Morf believes this because he believes The Confession
Letter. Sometime in the past decade or two, Morf read The Confession Letter and
became enamored with it. He believed in it. He took it to Vegas and married it
in an Elvis chapel. I hate to be the one to tell Morf this, but The Confession
Letter has been unfaithful to him. Its no good. It lied to him from the start.
Someone should do to Morf like Cher did to Nicholas Cage in _M_o_o_n_s_t_r_u_c_k.

If you want to go on believing The Confession Letter, youve got to throw out
everything else. The several friends of Cheri Bates who were inside the library
that night--youve got to ignore them when they say she wasnt there. All the
library patrons who were parked on Terracina Drive, who walked to their cars
without seeing a blonde having trouble with her carpay no attention to those
people. Cheri Batess stomach, which magically stopped digesting the supper she
ate before 5pm, beginning at roughly 6:20pm that eveningmaybe it ran out of
acid? Cheri Batess car, which was unlocked with the windows rolled down and
the keys in the ignition and her books and notepad left on the front seat, as
if shed suddenly had to leave it in that conditionshe probably just decided,
To Hell with it! Ive got to go walk down a dark alley 75 yards from here!

Morf, whatever you do, dont let go of that life raft, The Confession Letter;
otherwise, you might drown in a sea of uncertainty.

Plus, we KNOW the killer would never lie to us!

I agree with Michael Cole here. As the Zodiologists website pointed out some
time ago, why on Earth would a killer send the police a letter that points a
finger in his own direction? If the letter suggests that the killer had a hot-
blooded motive for the murder, doesnt that suggest we look in the opposite
direction?

John Douglas, in one of his books, mentions that anytime a killer seems to
leave a clue intentionally for the police, his own instinct is to turn and look
180° from where the murderer is pointing.

Cheri Batess character is pretty well-known, as attested to by friends, her
fiance, and people who saw her fairly regularly such as the staff at Sandys
Restaurant.

The circumstances were dealing with here are not subtle. Cheri was known to be
terrified of the dark and to be leery of strangers, and yet we are told she
walked willingly with guy who accosted her at her car, without first trying to
phone her friends or her dad, who could have come and picked her up.

The police dont believe in handwriting analysis. Morf doesnt believe in

Again, RPD doesnt buy the Zodiac link because the latents from Riverside dont

Morf, get your DNA straight. The tissue under Cheri Batess fingernails was too
decomposed to yield a DNA profile. What RPD had was mitochondrial DNA, which
meant the hairs stuck to Cheris palm in blood contained the root. mtDNA is
different from what is found in saliva, sweat, and semen.

The wound pattern, as cited in the autopsy, is consistent with an attack by at
least two assailants. If the victim had not been restrained in some way during
the assault, its difficult to imagine how she had superficial wounds to the
torso, hands, and face, and deep slashes to the throat, particularly in a dark
alley, and particularly in a situation where she was literally fighting for her
life and had apparently torn off her killers wrist watch and pulled out his
hair.

Let me see if I can compare our two positions:

Morf believes Cheri was killed by a local boy, in a sudden rage, a boy who
later became the Zodiac. None of the particulars of his viewpoint makes any
sense, except for the Zodiacs involvement.

I believe Cheri was abducted circa 6:20pm that evening. At least two people
were involved in the abduction. After she was led away, one of the abductors
pulled the wire from the distributor, opened the door of her car, and leaned
over onto the passenger seat, leaving a greasy palm print as he reached for her
purse and student ID. He then walked into the library and charged out books on
her card to place her in the library. He brought the books back to the car and
left them on the front seat with her notepad. He then walked away, not
bothering to roll up the windows or take the keys out of the ignition. Its
useless to speculate about Cheris abduction; she may have been driven
elsewhere or may have been kept inside a van or other vehicle. She was brought
back to Terracina Drive circa 10:30pm or so, walked down the alley, probably at
gunpoint, with the second assailant making sure not to walk too close to the
other two so his footprints wouldnt be associated with theirs. The man in
front of Cheri most likely held the gun; the man behind her had the knife. When
they reached the spot, the man in front grabbed her and held her while the man
in back slit her throat from behind with several slashes. The scratches to the
face, hands, and torso were coincidental to this process. My guess is the
attack lasted just seconds and had been very carefully rehearsed by the two
men. Cheri had time to get her fingers in the way of some of the slashes, and
managed to pull the hair of one of the men, and screamed very loudly. Her
second scream would have been muffled because of her wounds, and she would have
lost consciousness very quickly.

Once she was on the ground, one of the men pulled out the Timex watch and
dropped it ten feet from the body. The missing car was on Riverside, not
Terracina, so it may have made more sense to them to make their immediate
getaway on foot and then double back to the car.

Im not sure about the two men spotted near the scene with flashlights at 1:
30am. Its conceivable that someone had notified security at the college or
police that a scream was heard, and that two plainclothes men came out and
looked around. What argues against this is that theres no record of the
incident in any of the police reports or newspaper articles, other than the
witness account.

What makes a lot less sense is that the killers would return to the scene of
the crime because one of them was missing a wrist watch. First, if youve got a
flashlight, youre going to find a black-banded watch on bright gravel thats
ten feet from the body in no time flat, especially if the beam from the
flashlight is reflected back by the watch face. Secondly, and I cannot stress
this enough, a Timex watch in 1966 was as common an item as you might find;
David Faraday had one on, as did Paul Stine, both with black bands. All the
speculation you read on Zodiac websites about that watch somehow identifying
its owner (Bob Barnett was known to have a watch just like that!) is
ludicrous. This was before DNA profiling, so DNA from sweat on the watch
couldnt be gathered. There was latex paint on the watch, but that wouldnt
have narrowed things down much.

Most of the people who post on Zodiac killer message boards were either little
kids or werent alive yet when Cheri Bates was killed. No killer in his right
mind would go back to the crime scene to retrieve a watch worn by most of the
males in the general population in 1966. And how likely is it that the killer
wouldnt have noticed his watch missing right away? If you just murdered
someone, and had planned the murder ahead of time, wouldnt your first instinct
be to check the time on your watch? In 1966, very few cars had clocks on their
dashboards.

That Timex was not accidentally left behind; the killers left it there on
purpose.

Morf, you dont need a second memo. The behavior of RPD tells you the prints
didnt match. They were enthusiastic about the Zodiac link in the original
memo, and they started their investigation of Bob Barnett in earnest afterward,
and they remain adamant that the Zodiac did not kill Bates. I dont need
Riverside PD to tell me what happened with the latent comparison; I can figure
it out.

Michael Cole makes a compelling point here; I was so focused on the Bates
murder that I didnt see it for myself. Although, as Pierre Bidou pointed out,
the modus operandi of the murders was technically different each time out,
there is strong evidence that the Zodiac thought out his attacks in meticulous
detail.

If the reader will review my version of the Cheri Bates murder above, and then
consider how similar the overall approach was to what happened at Lake
Berryessa, and in the Kathleen Johns incident, this Premeditated Situational
Control that Mike talks about becomes evident. For that matter, what happened
in Presidio Heights, where, as Armstrong points out in the movie, the killer
waits for the driver to put the cab in PARK before shooting him, and then gets
into the front seat and cuts off part of Paul Stines shirt so he can send
pieces of it with his letters, shows that the level of premeditation went
beyond situational control. He wasnt just trying to control his victims; he
was trying to control the entirety of the event, including how that event was
perceived afterward.

Well, thats all for now.
