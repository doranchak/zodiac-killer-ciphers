					<div class="sf_pagetitle" ><div style="display:block;" ><h1>Voice Box</h1></div></div><div class="sf_content" ><div class="LayoutContainer" style="display:block;" ><div><div style="display:block;overflow:hidden;" ><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those of you who watch my videos know that I have <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spasmodic_dysphonia">spasmodic dysphonia</a>, a neurological disorder where the muscles around my vocal folds clench involuntarily.  Every couple of months I get a double injection of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Botulinum_toxin">botox</a>, one on each side of my throat, which relaxes the muscles temporarily and allows me to have a relatively normal voice.<br />
<br />
I went for the injections on Monday afternoon, and took the opportunity to ask my doctor about Cheri Bates&#8217;s voice box.  The first thing the doctor told me was that it is virtually impossible to decapitate anyone with a knife.  The bones of the spine are sturdy enough that you&#8217;d need an axe or a guillotine to cut completely through the neck.  However, since the larynx itself is located in the front of the throat, and since the victim's thyroid cartilage is described as deeply cut on each side, it seems reasonable to assume that the voice box was compromised.<br />
<br />
<b>Neck Organs:<br />
The thyroid cartilage is obliquely cut on each side. Each cut is about 3 cm leng and angle from lateral above to medially below forming a somewhat Y shape structure with the apex at about the mid portion of the thyroid cartilage anteriorly. The upper edges are cut much deeper than the interior portions. The medial edges of the upper portions of the right and left lobes of the thyroid are partially incised. The right and left superficial jugular veins are completely transected. The right common carotid artery is completely transected about 2 cm above its origin.</b><br />
<br />
Having said all this, the medical examiner wonders, in his summary, why the victim didn&#8217;t run for help.<br />
<br />
<b>As the result of the rapid blood loss the subject would go late shock rapidly and undoubtedly would become unconscious and die in several minutes. The time interval of minutes might make me wonder why she wouldn&#8217;t scream and run for help, however, it is very likely that the suddenness and fear caused by the attack caused her to be faint, hence, allowing no time for many long and loud calls for help. The syncope would then blend late the unconsciousness from blood loss and on into death.<br />
<br />
</b>I'm wondering, having looked at this passage several times in recent weeks, if I haven't misread what the medical examiner was trying to say here.&nbsp; If you read that paragraph carefully, the autopsy surgeon appears to be asking why the victim wouldn't scream and run AFTER her throat was cut.<br />
<br />
But I'm not sure that's what he's saying after all.<br />
<br />
I think what Dr. Modglin means is, WHY WOULD THE VICTIM JUST STAND THERE AND ALLOW HER THROAT TO BE CUT BY A SINGLE ASSAILANT, WHEN THERE WERE NO OTHER DISABLING WOUNDS ANYWHERE ON HER BODY?<br />
<br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My doctor agrees with me, and disagrees with what the medical examiner seems to be saying here.  If her
carotid artery and jugular veins were transected, she would likely lose
consciousness very quickly and die within minutes, and therefore could not have run away once her throat was cut.<br />
<br />
But, oddly enough, that's what the medical examiner DOES say at first:<br />
<br />
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>As the result of the rapid
blood loss the subject would go late shock rapidly and undoubtedly would
become unconscious and die in several minutes.</b><br />
</font><br />
If your throat is cut, you pass out in a matter of seconds and die within minutes.<br />
<br />
So what the medical examiner is actually saying is, WHY DIDN'T SHE RUN WHEN SHE HAD THE CHANCE?<br />
<br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My doctor told me that had the victim&#8217;s larynx been cut through, she could not have screamed.<br />
<br />
And yet, a witness in the area reported hearing "an awful scream" circa 10:30pm.<br />
<br />
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">So we know Cheri Bates probably screamed before she was murdered.<br />
<br />
If she had time to scream, she had time to get away.<br />
<br />
But that's assuming there was only one killer.</font><br />
<br />
<b>The lacerations are typical of knife cuts and the minimum instrument dimensions for a knife blade would be &#189; inch wide and 3 &#189; inches long. There were no &#8220;tell tale&#8221; marks to indicate it had been plunged in &#8220;up to the hilt&#8221;. The position(s) of the assailant is/are not &#8220;proof positive&#8221; from the study of the body.</b><br />
<br />
Here&#8217;s something else to think about.  The medical examiner stated that the knife used was at least 3 &#189; inches long and a half inch wide.  That means that the knife blade was 7 times longer than it was wide.<br />
<br />
If the knife blade is 7 times longer than it is wide, what sort of wound pattern would we expect, assuming the murder is a crime of passion?<br />
<br />
We would expect, for the most part, relatively short marks on the surface of the skin, and deep cuts.<br />
<br />
The autopsy reveals that the majority of the wounds on the body were superficial.  The surface lacerations were actually longer than the wounds were deep, with the exception of the neck area.  This is consistent with a slashing attack, and is completely inconsistent with a stabbing.<br />
<br />
To take this a step further, the autopsy suggests that the killer&#8217;s intent was to slash the victim&#8217;s throat, since that is where the deep lacerations are.  All the oher wounds are superficial, defensive, and presumably collateral.<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates&#8217;s killer could not have acted out of rage, because an enraged killer would have stabbed the victim, particularly if he were making a frontal attack.  If the killer had somehow gotten behind the victim, it would have been much more difficult for the victim to yank his watch off and pull his hair out.  And, while the petechial hemorrhaging is consistent with some sort of headlock maneuver, one would expect the victim&#8217;s neck to be heavily bruised if she had been choked to the point where the subcutaneous skin of the forehead showed hemorrhaging; the medical examiner does not note any such bruising.<br />
<br />
The medical examiner raises the possibility that Cheri Bates fainted out of fear of the sudden attack, but that scenario is ruled out by the rather dramatic evidence of a struggle.&nbsp; And if she fainted, she probably didn't come to in time to scream.<br />
<br />
If Cheri Bates was assaulted by a single killer, one has to wonder why she wasn&#8217;t stabbed, and why she didn&#8217;t run away, since the absence of bruising on her neck and arms tells us her killer didn&#8217;t hold her with one hand and slash with the other.<br />
<br />
The Cheri Bates homicide more closely resembles a cold-blooded execution than it does a hot-blooded messy murder.  It was quick, efficient, and likely involved two assailants, one in front and one behind.  The man in front held a gun on her, the second man stepped in behind her and immediately began slashing her throat as the first man ducked and wrapped his arms around her to keep her from struggling or fleeing.  The hemorrhaging to the forehead was caused by the intense struggle.  Once she was subdued, they lowered her to the ground and dropped the watch a few feet away.  One of them, most likely the one in front, was scratched and had tufts of hair pulled out.  It&#8217;s conceivable that, since a young man with a beard was seen inside the library and then did not return for the reenactment, that the hairs stuck to Cheri&#8217;s palm in blood were actually from his beard rather than the top of his head.<br />
<br />
The murder could not have happened the way The Confession Letter says it did.  Cheri Bates was not choked and could not have been, since the medical examiner noted no hemorrhaging in the eyes and her throat was not bruised.  She was not stabbed, and no broken blade was found either inside her body or on the ground.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s fair to say that the Cheri Bates case is the most misunderstood murder in the history of homicides, and most of the misunderstanding stems from the public acceptance of the account given in The Confession Letter.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s amazing, isn&#8217;t it?<br />
<br />
Zodiac hobbyists aren&#8217;t sure The Confession Letter was written by her killer.<br />
<br />
They aren&#8217;t sure The Confession Letter was written by the Zodiac.<br />
<br />
They aren&#8217;t sure the victim was killed by the Zodiac.<br />
<br />
But they are ABSOLUTELY SURE of one thing: The Confession Letter is 100% accurate.<br />
<br />
That version is in conflict with the eyewitness accounts, with what the victim&#8217;s friends and fiance have said about her, with what the victim&#8217;s stomach contents tell us, with what the victim&#8217;s injuries tell us, and with what the crime scene tells us.<br />
<br />
It's the one thing about the Zodiac case I'll admit I don't understand.<br />
<br />
Maybe I should ask ZKF?<br />
<br />
Here are some ZKF posters holding forth on this otherwise inexplicable phenomenon:<br />
<br />
<b>if the facts don't mesh with theory, simply ignore them altogether. Brilliant.</b><br />
Aquiman<br />
<br />
<b>An inability to be honest with oneself - which logically conflicts with such things as facts and truth.</b><br />

Whatever happened to ZKF anyway?&nbsp; Outside of Dave Oranchak doing his Gareth Penn impression, it's dead as a doornail.<br />
<br />
Oh well.&nbsp; I will be posting further insights on the case shortly.<br />

ZKF, not so much. </font></div></div></div></div>
