					<div class="sf_pagetitle" ><div style="display:block;" ><h1>Butterfield PDF</h1></div></div><div class="sf_content" ><div class="LayoutContainer" style="display:block;" ><div><div style="display:block;overflow:hidden;" ><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I was looking through Mike Butterfield's 2007 PDF, <b>Zodiac Death Machine,</b> which Tom emailed to me about a year ago.&nbsp; I'm going to write a detailed timeline of the Cheri Bates murder in the next few days, which will be more formalized and concise than what I've put up on the website so far, but I was curious to see what Butterfield's own timeline looked like.<br />
<br />
Butterfield's timeline for Riverside is largely just a retyping of what's in Graysmith's <b>Zodiac</b>.&nbsp; There are also numerous factual errors, just careless mistakes of the type Butterfield would gloat over with gleeful insults if someone else had made them.&nbsp; He does comment on the autopsy, however:<br />
<br />
<b>The autopsy report listed &#8220;lacerations of the face, neck, hands, arm, forearms, lung, common carotid artery, thyroid, thyroid cartilage, rib&#8221; and &#8220;abrasions of face, hands, forearms&#8221; with &#8220;petechiae of the forehead.&#8221; Petechiael hemorrhages occur when blood flow is interrupted and vessels burst beneath the skin, or often in the eyes during strangulation.<br />
<br />
</b>While I'm inclined to agree with Butterfield on this, that the petechiae would seem to point to the victim having been choked at some stage of the attack, it's interesting that the surgeon neither mentioned them in his comments section, nor noted the presence of discolored skin in the neck area.<br />
<br />
If Cheri Bates was choked at some point, as the petechiae might suggest and as The Confession Letter attests, it would seem to offer two different descriptions of her attacker:<br />
<br />
1, Either her attacker was exceptionally strong, in the sense that he could choke a very young, very athletic victim with one hand while slashing her with a knife held in his other hand, all the while keeping her from running away; OR<br />
<br />
2, she was attacked by two men, one from the front and one behind (which more easily explains the absence of flight).<br />
<br />
The absence of discoloration to the neck argues against the first scenario; however expert her killer may have been, if he was strong enough to have held her with one hand by the throat, the victim's neck would have been heavily bruised.<br />
<br />
A more likely explanation for the burst blood vessels would be the victim having to grapple with two men, one of whom held her (likely with her mouth covered) while the other slashed her throat (most likely from behind).&nbsp; It's also the only scenario that makes sense of the concentration of wounds in her throat.&nbsp; Since all her other wounds were superficial, and since we know that she scratched the hair out of one of her assailants (and presumably pulled his watch off), the chances of a single killer being able to slash her throat so accurately in a pitch dark alley with an uncooperative victim would seem pretty slim.&nbsp; <br />
<b><br />
Few of the wounds were deep; most were superficial lacerations of the arms and breasts. These wounds, as well as the cuts on Cheri Jo&#8217;s hands, and those to her lips, cheek and face, appeared to have occurred as the killer restrained the victim.</b><br />
<br />
Again, I don't see how an individual killer manages to inflict mortal wounds in ONE area of the victim's body and superficial wounds everywhere else.&nbsp; I don't see how an individual killer restrains a victim and cuts her throat almost clear through without causing significant damage anywhere else, particularly under those circumstances and with that victim.<br />
<br />
The petechiael hemorrhaging does suggest Cheri Bates was restrained at some point . . . but probably not by one killer.<br />
