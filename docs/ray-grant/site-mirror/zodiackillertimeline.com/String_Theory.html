<i>Convert a document the size of The Confession Letter to Morse code, and then check it for the strings I found in The Confession Letter, using the SEARCH function of your computer. It&#8217;s a fairly simple exercise for someone of your expertise. The strings are cited at TZMS 1993-1, pages 118-125.  Let me tell you what you&#8217;re going to discover for yourself. You&#8217;ll type in a given string, hit the SEARCH button . . . and nothing. Over and over and over again.<br />
</i><br />
<b>That's not what I found at all.  Out of curiosity, I ran some experiments, and found the following problems with your approach:<br />
<br />
1) Converting text to morse code, and streaming the zeroes and ones together, allows for the discovery of a vast number of words within a single document.<br />
2) With such a large pool of words to select from, it is easy to discover words that fit some pre-determined narrative<br />
3) Therefore, we have to take on faith that you've selected only the words that are truly planted there by the author of the letters.<br />
<br />
First, let's look at the confession letter.  I used this transcription of the letter: <a href=" http://code.google.com/p/zodiac-killer-ciphers/source/browse/trunk/letters/1966-11-29-the-confession.txt">  http://code.google.com/p/zodiac-killer-ciphers/source/browse/trunk/letters/1966-11-29-the-confession.txt</a><br />
<br />
Here is what it looks like when I converted it to digitized Morse:  <a href="http://zodiackillerciphers.com/ray-grant/confession-letter-to-morse.txt">http://zodiackillerciphers.com/ray-grant/confession-letter-to-morse.txt</a><br />
<br />
I ran a word search algorithm on the digitized Morse.  It scans a large dictionary file and looks for each word.  Any word that is already in the original plain text is ignored.<br />
<br />
The algorithm found around 76,000 words:  <a href="http://zodiackillerciphers.com/ray-grant/confession-letter-founds-words.txt">http://zodiackillerciphers.com/ray-grant/confession-letter-founds-words.txt</a>   The format of this file is:  Word length, word, word-to-morse, and location in file.<br />
<br />
To demonstrate the ease at which words are found using the morse code scheme, let's look at the article you posted in response to my email.  The confession letter is 1625 characters long if you remove all of the non-alphabet stuff.  So, I created a version of your article that is also 1625 characters long:  <a href="http://zodiackillerciphers.com/ray-grant/ray-article.txt">http://zodiackillerciphers.com/ray-grant/ray-article.txt</a><br />
<br />
Here it is converted to Morse:  <a href="http://zodiackillerciphers.com/ray-grant/ray-article-to-morse.txt">http://zodiackillerciphers.com/ray-grant/ray-article-to-morse.txt</a><br />
<br />
When I ran the word search algorithm on it, it found around 73,000 words: <a href=" http://zodiackillerciphers.com/ray-grant/ray-article-found-words.txt"> http://zodiackillerciphers.com/ray-grant/ray-article-found-words.txt</a><br />
<br />
If you look at both lists, you'll find that over 11,000 words can be found in both digitizations.  Here are those words:  <a href="http://zodiackillerciphers.com/ray-grant/words-found-in-both.txt">http://zodiackillerciphers.com/ray-grant/words-found-in-both.txt</a>  You can easily see interesting words in there such as Saturn, Mars, earth, druid, death, snare, sneak, dante, eight, eleven, zeus, witch, etc.<br />
<br />
It's clear to me that the appearance of any words using this scheme is the result of pure chance.<br />
<br />
What do you think of these problems?<br />

<br />
In 1970, I took an American History course at Pitt from <a href="http://www.history.ucr.edu/People/Faculty/Tobey/index.html">Professor Ronald Tobey</a>.  Although he gave me an A, Dr. Tobey told me I had an annoying habit of ignoring the essay questions he asked and, instead, giving very meticulous answers to questions that were superficially similar to but not the same as the ones he&#8217;d actually asked.<br />
<br />
Here&#8217;s the passage from my article that you quoted:<br />
<br />
<i>Convert a document the size of The Confession Letter to Morse code, and then check it for the strings I found in The Confession Letter, using the SEARCH function of your computer. It&#8217;s a fairly simple exercise for someone of your expertise. The strings are cited at TZMS 1993-1, pages 118-125.  Let me tell you what you&#8217;re going to discover for yourself. You&#8217;ll type in a given string, hit the SEARCH button . . . and nothing. Over and over and over again.<br />
</i><br />
1, You DID convert a document the size of The Confession Letter to Morse code.  Thank you for getting that far with my instructions.  I think that&#8217;s the record for a ZKF poster.<br />
<br />
However, you did NOT <br />
<br />
2, then check it for THE STRINGS I FOUND in The Confession Letter . . . The strings are cited at TZMS 1993-1, pages 118-125.<br />
<br />
Since you did not follow my instructions to the letter, the whole point of the exercise was lost on you.  I will, however, do what Professor Tobey did with me, and comment on the unasked question that you did choose to answer:<br />
<br />
<b>Out of curiosity, I ran some experiments, and found the following problems with your approach:<br />
<br />
1) Converting text to morse code, and streaming the zeroes and ones together, allows for the discovery of a vast number of words within a single document.</b><br />
<br />
&#8216;Morse&#8217; needs to be capitalized because it&#8217;s someone&#8217;s name.  I don&#8217;t recall suggesting that only a small number of words was available when you convert a document to Morse code and then streamed the zeroes and ones together.  Maybe I implied it unintentionally?   <br />
<br />
<b>2) With such a large pool of words to select from, it is easy to discover words that fit some pre-determined narrative</b><br />
<br />
Then it&#8217;s your job to demonstrate something along those lines, particularly if it&#8217;s easy.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s exasperating to have to keep saying this, but, in cryptography, CONTEXT IS EVERYTHING.<br />
<br />
Thus, someone who chose to do what you&#8217;re suggesting COULD NOT simply select words to fit a pre-determined narrative, because his interpretation would still have to be consistent on some level with the Zodiac literature and crimes.  To cite two examples of this sort of thing, both Robert Graysmith and Corey Starliper proposed solutions to The 340 that are similar in tone and language to the Zodiac letters.  I don&#8217;t agree with their methodology, and I&#8217;m sure you don&#8217;t, either, but it&#8217;s telling that they made sure their solutions read like Zodiac text.<br />
<br />
<b>3) Therefore, we have to take on faith that you've selected only the words that are truly planted there by the author of the letters.</b><br />
<br />
This statement illustrates a basic fallacy about cryptography in the real world, which is that messages in the field are never subject to interpretation.  As I&#8217;ve pointed out in numerous places, including answering posts on <a href="http://zodiackillerfactsinfo.com/ZKF__First_TZMS_Thread.html ">ZKF</a>&nbsp; (Curt Rowlett section),<br />
the American high command was barely convinced that JN-25 predicted an invasion of Midway Island in 1942.  As William Manchester pointed out in <b>The Glory And The Dream</b>, The Purple Code predicted the attack on Pearl Harbor, and the Americans didn&#8217;t fail to act because of any conspiracy but because they didn&#8217;t take seriously what their own cryptographers were telling them. <br />
<br />
<b>It's clear to me that the appearance of any words using this scheme is the result of pure chance.</b><br />
<br />
I don&#8217;t think this is QUITE as clear as you think it is, Dave.  Let&#8217;s take a look at your examples.<br />
<br />
<b>You can easily see interesting words in there such as Saturn, Mars, earth, druid, death, snare, sneak, dante, eight, eleven, zeus, witch, etc.</b><br />
<br />
SATURN is a 14-digit string (Morse code/binary digits), MARS is 10 digits, EARTH is 11 digits, DRUID is 14, DEATH is 11, DANTE is 11, EIGHT is 11, ELEVEN is 13, WITCH is 14.<br />
<br />
A 14-digit string will show up once every 16,384 chances. Your example cites TWO instances of hits within documents of 1625 digits.  14 digits, which is the longest of the &#8220;interesting&#8221; strings you cite, should show up in ONE of those documents, purely by chance, about 1 out of every 10 times.  If you have TWO such instances, now you&#8217;re talking about 1 out of 100.  That sort of, kind of, <i>approximates</i> what Ray Grant is talking about, in a matter of speaking, except&#8212;and keep in mind, I&#8217;m not a statistician any more than I am a cryptographer&#8212;I&#8217;m guessing that 1 out of 100 is well within the scatterplot for this type of data.<br />
<br />
Here, offered merely for contrast, is a list of terms I cite in TZMS 1993, just from scanning the physical copy in my lap:<br />
<br />
<b>The Confession Letter<br />
ATLAS FIRE (22) 4194304 THREE FATES (21) 2097152 OBELISK (20) 1048576<br />
<br />
The Cryptogram<br />
DANTE&#8217;S ANTAEUS (26) 67,108,864, THREE FATES (21) <font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><b>2097152</b></font></b><br />
<br />
DANTE&#8217;S ANTAEUS, which was cited by Gareth Penn in <b>Times 17</b>, should appear once every 67,108,864 digits.  Since there are roughly 40,000 digits in the entire Zodiac literature, that means we should see that string once in 1677 Zodiacs.<br />
<br />
Getting TWO instances of THREE FATES would require 2778 Zodiacs.  Imagine that many Zodiacs running around, Dave.  It&#8217;s frightening.<br />
<br />
The word ROGATION appears in the VTH cover letter (7/31/69) and in both April 1970 letters.  The Major Rogation was on April 25th, which those two letters (April 20th and 28th) flank.  ROGATION is a 19-digit string which should appear once in 20 Zodiac literatures; it appears 3 times.<br />
<br />
I already mentioned ALIGHIERI, which appears in The Mikado Letter twice.<br />
<br />
To me, the most striking example of textual tampering can be found in The Confession Letter.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ve mentioned <b>Dante&#8217;s Inferno</b> numerous times, as did Gareth Penn.  As I&#8217;ve said, and as Gareth failed to point out, The Desk Poem&#8217;s first four lines are a paraphrase of the initial quatrain from <b>The Inferno</b>.<br />
<br />
The most &#8220;cryptographic&#8221; utterance in <b>Dante&#8217;s Inferno</b> is the brief speech of Nimrod from Canto 31, Line 67:<br />
<br />
<b>RAPHEL MAI AMECCHE ZABI ALMI</b><br />
<br />
In a sense, Nimrod&#8217;s speech is symbolic of the Zodiac&#8217;s literature, and in particular his ciphers, since they remain untranslated.<br />
<br />
RAPHEL appears twice in The Confession Letter, which itself consists of 4138 Morse digits.<br />
<br />
The first instance begins with digit #2212.  Oddly enough, 2212 is a backward form of the Timex watch time in Riverside&#8212;12:22.<br />
<br />
But the single most striking placement can be found in the covertext character numbers for RAPHEL #2:<br />
<br />
<b>MAKING HER PAY FOR THE BRUSHOFFS</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      <b>K &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;     I &nbsp;&nbsp;    N&nbsp;     G &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;     H &nbsp;       E&nbsp;&nbsp;     R &nbsp;&nbsp;    P<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     101 00   10   110  0000  0    010  0110</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>010010110000000100</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>010 01 0110 0000 0 0100<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R &nbsp;&nbsp;    A &nbsp;&nbsp;    P&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      H &nbsp;&nbsp;    E &nbsp;&nbsp;    L<br />
</b><br />
This placement is so remarkable that I&#8217;m going to number my points to highlight it:<br />
<br />
<b>1, &#8220;RAPHEL&#8221; is the first thing out of Nimrod&#8217;s mouth;<br />
2, It is not the first thing we know about him&#8212;he&#8217;s buried in the soil of the 9th Circle &amp; chained;<br />
3, The Confession Letter is not the first thing we know about the Zodiac&#8212;the Bates murder is;<br />
4, But The Confession Letter IS the first thing he SAYS;<br />
5, In other words, RAPHEL and The Confession Letter are figuratively synonyms;<br />
6, The Confession Letter was postmarked November 29&#8212;&#8220;11-29&#8221;;<br />
7, The &#8216;K&#8217; of MAKING is the start of the covertext for the beginning of RAPHEL in the undertext;<br />
8, The &#8216;K&#8217; of MAKING is character #1129 of The Confession Letter.<br />
</b><br />
All of this can be found on page 334 of TZMS 1993-2.<br />
<br />
The &#8220;no context&#8221; approach of Dave Oranchak might make sense if the Zodiac had only sent conventional messages to the newspapers.  But he also sent ciphers, three of which remain untranslated, his other communications contain cryptic passages, and even his crimes featured odd notes that seemed to have some secret meaning.  Why is it so hard to believe that his letters contained undertexts?<br />
<br />
Check out <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voynich_manuscript">The Voynich Manuscript</a>:<br />
<br />
See, if I were going to try to dope out The Voynich Manuscript, this is just my take on it, I&#8217;d probably try a brute force computer attack before I did any research on the history or background (why bother doing any of that?).<br />
