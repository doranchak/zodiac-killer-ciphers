					<div class="sf_pagetitle" ><div style="display:block;" ><h1>Horan Timeline</h1></div></div><div class="sf_content" ><div class="LayoutContainer" style="display:block;" ><div><div style="display:block;overflow:hidden;" >I happened to be reading the Thomas Horan articles on Zodiac Revisited, and I remembered having responded to some of Horan's points when they were posted on ZKF back in April.&nbsp; Since most of the posters on ZodiacRevisited.com read this website, I thought I'd reprint part of an article I put up on ZodiacKillerFactsInfo.com back then.<br />
<br />
With all due respect to G. Gluckman, tricking Horan into saying his name backward won't work.&nbsp; It worked with Mr. Mxyzptlk, because what that pesky sprite conjured was real magic (it also worked with God himself, in the great cult movie <b>Warlock</b>).&nbsp; Logic says if you're under the influence of a SPELL, you can reverse it by SPELLING the sorcerer's name backward and getting him to read it aloud.<br />
<br />
I'm doubting Thomas has any such powers; he's more a street huckster selling sideshow spiel.<br />
<br />
You put him out of business by showing the crimped corners of his crooked deck.<br />
<br />
This won't take long.<br />
<br />
Horan claims that The Writer (October 13, 1969) demonstrates that he knows nothing about the murder by citing the corner of Washington &amp; Maple in the first Presidio Heights letter, when the crime occurred at Washington &amp; Cherry.<br />
<br />
The opposite is true.&nbsp; "Washington &amp; Maple" is what Paul Stine wrote in his trip book.&nbsp; The Writer is, in fact, showing that he knows what the original destination given to the cab driver was.<br />
<br />
If The Writer was not also The Killer, he'd have written "Washington &amp; Cherry" in the letter.&nbsp; The police report and the original newspaper accounts mention "Washington &amp; Cherry", not "Washington &amp; Maple".&nbsp; No police confederate of The Writer would have been aware of the trip book entry, either, because no one would have assumed that the trip book entry would differ from the actual crime scene location.&nbsp; The only ones "on the inside" who would have been aware of the discrepancy were Toschi and Armstrong, the two detectives assigned to the case . . . so is Horan claiming that either Toschi or Armstrong was supplying The Writer with his inside information?&nbsp; Two-man detective teams are notoriously closed-mouthed about progress they're making on a case (as Mark Ruffalo/Toschi demonstrates in a lunch counter scene with Jake Gyllenhaal/Graysmith in Fincher's <b>Zodiac</b>).<br />
<br />
If that isn't enough of a stretch for you, let's pull out the shirt tail.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
<br />
The faking of the letters depends on someone &#8220;on the inside&#8221;, a police confederate of The Writer, somehow gaining access to Paul Stine&#8217;s shirt.  I continue to wait for Mr. Horan to explain how that could have been done.&nbsp; Keep in mind that no one processing the shirt would have been aware that it might have been cut by the killer; they would have noticed that the shirt tail was cut off, but would have assumed that that had happened prior to, and in a manner unconnected with, the murder.<br />
<br />
We have photos of the shirt as it looked after it was removed from the body at the morgue.  Fully half the back of the shirt was chopped off.  For The Writer&#8217;s confederate to cut the shirt, he&#8217;d have to have done it either prior to the body arriving at the morgue, or immediately prior to the body&#8217;s being processed at the morgue.  Horan isn&#8217;t forthcoming about who might have done this, but it&#8217;s a short list of potential suspects:<br />
<br />
1. Officer Armond Pelissetti<br />
2. Officer Frank Peda<br />
3. Morgue Steward Doucette<br />
4. Inspector Walt Kracke<br />
5. Inspector Dave Toschi<br />
<br />
Only those five people had access to the body prior to its arrival at the morgue, with Frank Peda being the most likely of the five, since he was left alone at the cab when Pelissetti went walking down Cherry Street.&nbsp; I can't imagine that Frank Peda, if he was in cahoots with The Writer, would have taken the chance of getting into the front of the cab and hacking off the tail of Paul Stine's shirt.&nbsp; Witnesses were present (the teenagers who saw the killer), more were collecting at the corner (since the police car was parked in the middle of the intersection), and handling the body would mean leaving his own prints in the front seat.<br />
<br />
Morgue stewards typically work in two-man tandems, and the body is bagged and strapped and rolled into the back of the van and then locked down.&nbsp; Cutting off the victim's shirt tail would have been problematical, to say the least.&nbsp; The body would be by itself for the trip to the morgue, but both stewards would normally ride in the front seat.<br />
<br />
6. an anonymous morgue employee<br />
<br />
What are the chances that The Writer&#8217;s confederate was a morgue employee?  The only employee with a conceivable motive to hack the shirt would be a medical examiner or the coroner; anyone lower than that would not likely be The Writer&#8217;s confederate, since his value prior to the murder would have been negligible.  If The Writer&#8217;s confederate is a morgue professional, why would The Writer have begun with the murders in Vallejo and Napa?  Wouldn&#8217;t a disgruntled medical examiner have provided material from other, more anonymous murders from the San Francisco area, preferably John Does?<br />
<br />
The other problem with the shirt fragments is that The Writer had been sending his letters in The Bay Area since July, and none of the newspapers had suggested that the letters themselves were hoaxes.  So why take the additional chance of bringing a confederate aboard when there&#8217;s no need to do that?  Sending the shirt fragments is a major step up from just providing crime scene details; it puts both The Writer and his confederate at a very serious risk of obstruction of justice, one he doesn&#8217;t have to take based on the previous acceptance of the letters.  So why do it?<br />
<br />
But the strongest argument against the shirt being hacked by anyone other than the killer is the timing.&nbsp; Paul Stine is murdered on Saturday, October 11, 1969; The Writer mails his first Presidio Heights letter on Monday, October 13, 1969.&nbsp; If a month had gone by between the murder and the first letter (as happened, for example, in Riverside), one could argue that The Writer waited until it became clear that police were probably not going to solve the murder.<br />
<br />
For The Writer to mail the bloody fragment a mere two days after the murder, he's taking a tremendous chance that the Stine murder will not be solved AFTER police receive the letter with the shirt swatch.&nbsp; If it is, down the toilet goes all his work on The Cryptogram.&nbsp; The Cryptogram cover letters are mailed many months after the Lake Herman Road murders, and almost a full month after the Blue Rock Springs murder.&nbsp; And The Writer never says anything about the Lake Berryessa attack.<br />
<br />
A cabbie murderer is the personification of a disorganized killer.&nbsp; So why would such an elaborate hoaxer go to all the trouble of obtaining a piece of a victim's bloody shirt . . . and then risk exposure of his hoax by sending that swatch 48 hours after the murder?&nbsp; It's not as if he wasn't going to write about the murder in more detail--he does just that almost a month later.<br />
<br />
It doesn't make sense.<br />
<br />
Of course, Horan's Hypothesis never did.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</div></div></div></div>
