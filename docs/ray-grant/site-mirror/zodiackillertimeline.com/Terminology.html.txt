Zodiac Killer Timeline
************ TTeerrmmiinnoollooggyy ************
Lets begin our reconstruction of the Zodiac murders by defining our terms.

Those who DVR TV series will have noted that specific episodes are now given a
number indicating which season of the series it belongs to and which episode of
that season it was. For instance, the most recent episode of the Person of
Interest series was entitled No Good Deed, and designated S01/Ep22 (Season 1,
Episode 22).

To take advantage of peoples familiarity with this system, Im going to adopt
a similar terminology here on Zodiac Killer Timeline. Each individual incident
will be given a name (e. g., St. Catherines Church, Sandys Restaurant)
and a number. The number will be preceded by a 2- or 3-letter code identifying
the Zodiac event (murder, letter, or other encounter) it belongs to, often the
venue associated with it. Since the individual incidents will be analyzed here
in extraordinary depth, I will attempt to simplify the overall structure to
compensate for the detail below.

RRiivveerrssiiddee ((RRIIVV))
LLaakkee HHeerrmmaann RRooaadd ((LLHHRR))
BBlluuee RRoocckk SSpprriinnggss ((BBRRSS))

. . . and so forth. St. Catherines Church would thus be RIV01, Sandys
Restaurant would be RIV02, et cetera.
