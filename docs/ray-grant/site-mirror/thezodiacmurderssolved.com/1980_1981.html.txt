As I said in the Intro Section, Gareth Penn is one of four Zodiac conspirators.



Gareth and I have never met in person (to my knowledge), but I became aware of
Gareth because he wrote an article in the July/August 1985 issue of TThhee MMeennssaa
BBuulllleettiinn entitled &#8220;The Calculus of Evil&#8221; which featured, in
bowdlerized form to protect Mensa from a possible lawsuit, his theory of the
real intent behind the Zodiac murders.



At the end of that article, the editor, Kent Van Cleave, added a footnote on
Gareth&#8217;s background, concluding with:

WWee aarree oommiittttiinngg rreeffeerreenncceess tthhaatt ssppeecciiffiiccaallllyy iiddeennttiiffyy hhiiss ssuussppeecctt,, wwhhiicchh mmaayy bbee

After reading the article, I immediately wrote to Gareth, and began a
correspondence by letter and telephone, which lasted the better part of four
years (almost five if you count Gareth&#8217;s letter of May 22, 1990).

I will discuss what Gareth sent to me in the SASE when we get to that part of
the story.

In 2010, Gareth made a rather lame attempt to misrepresent our relationship on
his anonymous blog (his name is nowhere to be found on it), _G_Z_4_2_1_6:

RRaayy GGrraanntt iiss jjuusstt oonnee ooff hhuunnddrreeddss ooff ppeeooppllee wwiitthh wwhhoomm II ccoorrrreessppoonnddeedd aa qquuaarrtteerr

hhiimm aass aa &&##88222200;;ffrriieenndd..&&##88222211;;

One can&#8217;t help being struck by how many of the investigators and
journalists Gareth encountered in TTiimmeess 1177 with whom he is no longer on
speaking terms at the end of the book; it&#8217;s pretty much all of them. Add
to that group myself, since I choose NOT to count serial killers among my
friends, and Gareth&#8217;s spouse at the time, Diane Merrill, who managed to
obtain a rather nasty divorce from my erstwhile friend some years later, in the
process somehow holding onto the house she&#8217;d bought with her own money
before taking in her homeless husband . . . and one is left with Hugh Penn,
Gareth&#8217;s birth father, who divorced Gareth&#8217;s mother when Gareth was
but a boy, and with whom Gareth had a relationship that can only be described
as . . . odd.

In my own case, if I wasn&#8217;t exactly Gareth&#8217;s friend, I think
it&#8217;s fair to say I was more than just a casual acquaintance:

1, Gareth sent me pictures of himself and his wife at the time, which I still
have.

2, Gareth asked me to help him advertise TTiimmeess 1177 through Mensa&#8217;s Special
Interest Groups, which are called SIGs, and which are technically independent
of Mensa (at the time, I was editor of two such groups, and knew many other
editors), after the dictatorial Executive Director of American Mensa, the late
Margot Seitelman, refused him access to any official publication (whether he
paid for it or not).

3, I called Gareth immediately after the publication of TTiimmeess 1177 in 1987 to
give him my critique of the book. When I called again the next day, his wife
answered the phone, and told me that Gareth had been in a good mood ever since
talking to me. He clearly took my opinion very seriously, and he kept writing
to me in 1989 and 1990 even after he knew I suspected him, and had myself
ceased writing to him.

I was active in national Mensa politics, having run for First Vice-Chairman of
The American Mensa Committee in 1987, plus I went to lots of conventions (which
are called Regional Gatherings in Mensa), so besides our mutual interest in the
Zodiac case, we knew many of the same people. Eventually, Gareth&#8217;s
behavior, as witnessed by other members I knew in the group, became one of the
reasons I began to suspect him.

I will detail my personal interaction with Gareth when I get to it
chronologically. Gareth claims to have made his radian discovery in late 1980,
and I would not talk to him until the summer of 1985, so for the moment
I&#8217;ll keep myself out of the narrative.

What&#8217;s important for the reader to realize here is that there are TWO
Gareth Penns.

There&#8217;s the REAL Gareth Penn.

And then there&#8217;s the Gareth Penn as he presents himself in TTiimmeess 1177.

Remember what I said earlier about comic book superheroes being similar to
serial killers, because both have secret identities?

I&#8217;ll cite some examples off the top of my head (the reader may note that
I&#8217;m a DDCC CCoommiiccss, not a MMaarrvveell CCoommiiccss, person):

The Zodiac Project had Michael O&#8217;Hare, Berta Margoulies, and Hugh Penn,
but the franchise also had a spin-off character named Gareth Penn. Where other
serial killers had flirted with being their own publicity agents (Son of Sam
and The BTK Killer), and in at least one instance, the p. r. man was completely
independent of the killer (The Yorkshire Ripper and Wearside Jack), The Zodiac
Project is unique in having a DESIGNATED publicity agent who posed as an
independent investigator.

It&#8217;s important to realize that TTiimmeess 1177 isn&#8217;t a true life account
of what Gareth Penn did after he discovered The Mt. Diablo Radian. Gareth
helped plan the Zodiac events, so he already KNEW about The Mt. Diablo Radian.
His account of the discovery and some of the subsequent events is purely
fictitious, but some of what he reports actually happened.

It&#8217;s not as if Gareth Penn didn&#8217;t have encounters with Ken Narlow
and Bob Graysmith and Ray Grant during his journey toward the truth. He already
knew what the truth was. The only suspense was in whether he could con
investigators, both professional and amateur, into following up on his
theories, without them suspecting his own involvement.

Why would a conspirator in a serial murder case implicate his fellow
conspirators?

The Zodiac Project is, first and foremost, a puzzle, and there would be no
point in constructing such an elaborate maze if no one other than the
conspirators ever traveled down its dark corridors with a flashlight (perhaps
one taped to a gun barrel).

The only way to get people into your maze is to show them the entrance to it.

The Date

Let&#8217;s begin with the date itself.

In his book TTiimmeess 1177, Gareth Penn recounts making a momentous discovery on
Friday evening, December 26, 1980 (page 24). His discovery will come to be
known, in Zodiac killer circles, as The Mt. Diablo Radian.



Oddly enough, the radian discovery is the only event in Gareth&#8217;s book,
other than his recounting of the crimes themselves, in which he&#8217;s
specific about the date. Even when he makes the connection to Michael
O&#8217;Hare, on a trip to the Napa City and County Library (page 31), he
doesn&#8217;t specify the date when the discovery takes place, or even mention
the directory he found it in. Which is good, since no directory at that library
contains any such information.



The beginning of the Zodiac&#8217;s public activity, at least in The SF Bay
Area, is The Lake Herman Road murders on Friday evening, December 20, 1968.

The entry of Gareth Penn into the Zodiac case occurs with his discovery of The
Mt. Diablo Radian on Friday evening, December 26, 1980.

FFrriiddaayy eevveenniinngg,, DDeecceemmbbeerr 2200,, 11996688 == 1122--2200--6688 == 112222006688

When confronted by that pesky Ray Grant and his preoccupation with phone
numbers, Gareth Penn has shouted from the rooftops that his own number in 1983
. . .

((441155)) 449999--00667700

. . . just happens, purely by chance you understand, in its last five digits,
to contain the date of Donna Lass&#8217;s disappearance from Stateline/South
Lake Tahoe.

9900667700 == SSeepptteemmbbeerr 66,, 11997700

If that&#8217;s just a coincidence, is this also just a coincidence?

112222006688
112222668800

The only difference between those two number sequences is the placement of the
zero.

Times 17

Those readers familiar with my approach to examining conventional evidence know
that I like to start at the very beginning of a time sequence, and move forward
taking the smallest steps possible, downshifting to the lowest gear on the time
machine.

I&#8217;m going to do that here with TTiimmeess 1177; I&#8217;ll start with the very
first thing that happens, not in Gareth&#8217;s narrative but chronologically,
and move forward one moment at a time.



The first two-and-a-half pages of Gareth&#8217;s book recount the Zodiac events
in California, from Riverside to Presidio Heights:

DDuurriinngg tthhee ppeerriioodd OOccttoobbeerr 11996666 tthhrroouugghh OOccttoobbeerr 11996699 .. .. ..

The first event involving any action by Gareth Penn himself occurs about
halfway down page 3.



And it&#8217;s NOT his discovery of The Mt. Diablo Radian, but his account of a
conversation between himself and his father, Hugh Penn:

Gareth emphasizes that the message was conveyed by word of mouth, instead of
just saying that his father told him about the letter. I believe Gareth does
this to separate himself from the version of the letter that his father appears
to be putting forth. In other words, Gareth is giving himself Deniability, just
in case he&#8217;s challenged about the contents of a page that, as far as
anyone can tell, doesn&#8217;t even exist.

Well, maybe. But if this was the case, how did Hugh Penn gain access to a page
from a Zodiac letter that wasn&#8217;t available to the public?

Hugh Penn was an administrator/investigator working at the Attorney General's
office in Sacramento, an agency which did not itself have an ongoing Zodiac
investigation . . . yet he was somehow able to read a copy of the Zodiac letter
whose second page of text, if it exists, has never been published.

HHee rreessppoonnddeedd tthhaatt hhee hhaadd bbeeeenn wwoonnddeerriinngg ffoorr tthhee llaasstt tteenn yyeeaarrss wwhhaatt aa rraaddiiaann
wwaass..

This account might make more sense if Ken Narlow had been one of a handful of
police officers who had gotten a look at the letter. However, if Hugh Penn, an
administrator with the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, had seen it, then it's
clear the letter was looked at by a lot of law enforcement people, many of
whom, like Hugh Penn, had college degrees.



Keep in mind that, when the authorities received The Lake Tahoe Card, police
agencies dug numerous holes in the ground in the vicinity of Forest Pines,
trying to match the placement of the punched hole in the card itself, looking
for the burial spot of Donna Lass. So how likely is it that, if there WAS a
second page of text in The Mt. Diablo Letter, which said that &#8220;something
interesting&#8221; would be found if the authorities were to place a radian on
Mt. Diablo, that no one would think to try out that exercise for more than a
decade after it was received?

The answer is: No one thought to try out the exercise because the letter
DIDN&#8217;T say that.

The hint WAS given at the end of The Mikado Letter, but it was sufficiently
removed from the contents of The Mt. Diablo Letter that trying out the exercise
didn&#8217;t occur to anyone. And even if that second page of text DID exist,
and everyone missed the significance of the suggestion the first time out,
would Zodiac hobbyists still deny the validity of the radian exercise if the
Zodiac HAD said that &#8220;something interesting&#8221; would be found if
authorities placed a radian on Mt. Diablo? I doubt it.

If the second page of the letter said that, it hasn&#8217;t come to light in
the four decades since. In point of fact, nothing in The Mt. Diablo Letter
itself suggests the exercise Gareth proceeds with that Friday evening. To the
contrary, the single page of text as it&#8217;s been presented to us over the
past 40+ years seems quite self-contained:



Am I being too literal here?

Those readers who have followed the career of Gareth Penn have noted his
obsessive-compulsive insistence on linguistic precision. Here's a snippet from
a post on his blog about me:

I&#8217;ll discuss Gareth&#8217;s opinion of me at a later date. In the
meantime, note that Mr. Penn is an absolute stickler for literalism. When it
comes to What Was Said, What Wasn&#8217;t Said, and all the inferences,
implications, and nuances between those two antipodes, Gareth Penn is second-
to-none as a semantic hair-splitter.

This, then, seems odd in light of the casual approach Gareth Penn took to the
source of the single most important piece of information he ever received. If,
for example, you&#8217;re a reasonably intelligent person, and someone tells
you that you just won the Powerball lottery, the first thing you&#8217;re going
to do is check your ticket and make sure your numbers match what&#8217;s been
posted.

But Gareth is clearly so caught up in trying out the radian exercise that he
doesn&#8217;t bother to ask his dad any specifics about the part of the letter
where the exercise is suggested.

Again, someone who insists on precision in others is uncharacteristically vague
in his wording here. WHAT map of the Bay Area is he talking about? He
can&#8217;t mean the Phillips 66 map page that came with The Mt. Diablo Letter,
since Blue Rock Springs is NOT featured on that map. As the reader himself can
see, Gareth's 'X' for the Blue Rock Springs Park crime scene would be above the
top margin of the map page the Zodiac sent with The Mt. Diablo Letter.



If, on the other hand, by "a map of the Bay Area", he&#8217;s talking about a
USGS quadrangle (7.5 minutes squared), or even an entire 1DEG squared section,
since TTiimmeess 1177 is loaded with geodetic references, no Geological Survey map
features both VABM 3849 (Mt. Diablo) AND the points in Vallejo and Presidio
Heights. You might find all three on a standard service station map, or on a
much larger scale topographic map, but not with enough detail to determine the
placements of the murder scenes with the precision required of the exercise.

Gareth received a Master of Library Science from U. C. Berkeley in 1971. If you
have an advanced degree in library science, and you&#8217;re citing the single
most important fact you&#8217;ve ever encountered in a self-published book
(which means you have total control over how you present your material), how
precise are you going to be about the source of that information?

Remember, Gareth isn&#8217;t reporting what happened to him in real time. His
radian exercise took place in late 1980, and his book was written in the spring
of 1987. He had more than a half-dozen years to double-check and triple-check
his sources. Plus, since he&#8217;d been recounting those very events to
various investigators and reporters during that span, he figured to have lots
of practice explaining himself.

No such reference to &#8220;something interesting&#8221; exists in the original
letter, and Gareth never addresses the subject again.

Gareth&#8217;s version of events following his discovery of the radian is
interrupted by various verbal excursions into the history of language and the
methodology of communicating with extraterrestrial civilizations. He begins his
tale of radian discovery on page 3 of his book, and after numerous side trips,
resumes the narrative on page 24.

Note once again how Gareth dwells on the date. He wants us to remember the
exact date on which he made the radian discovery. This may seem natural to a
reader unfamiliar with the book, but one will page through TTiimmeess 1177 in vain
looking for dates applied to other events, including Gareth's making the
connection to Michael O&#8217;Hare.

Gareth Penn was born on January 1, 1941. If you take him at his word, he made
the radian discovery on December 26, 1980, six days short of his 40th birthday.
He had three degrees from Cal-Berkeley and had served in the army, and if he
wasn&#8217;t the most sociable person you were likely to meet, he was certainly
no one&#8217;s fool.

And yet, in the immediate aftermath of his radian discovery, he turns into
Dagwood Bumstead.

The logical thing for someone of Gareth's intelligence to do, assuming that
SFPD was the first call he'd make, would be to ask for the Homicide Detail.
Instead, he acts as if he's reporting a street crime.

The very first person I would have told would have been my father, since he was
the source of the information, and especially since, having been an
investigator and administrator for police and prosecutorial agencies, he would
likely know the best way to proceed with this information.

My next move would have been to arrange to look at the letter myself, if
possible. Since, by Gareth&#8217;s own admission, the information came by word
of mouth, it&#8217;s possible that something was lost in the translation
between what was on the page of the Zodiac&#8217;s letter and what his father
had related.

It&#8217;s unlikely that Hugh Penn saw a copy of the letter because he was
visiting one of the police agencies involved in the case, since the first thing
those investigators would have asked him is, Who wants to know? Penn,
Sr.&#8217;s job with the Attorney General&#8217;s Office would not have
included anything about the Zodiac, and couldn&#8217;t, since he worked for a
prosecutor&#8217;s office and the Zodiac hadn&#8217;t been identified or
arrested yet.

So the most likely explanation for Hugh Penn seeing a copy of the letter was
that a copy of the letter was sent to the specific office where he was working,
and he was able to get a look at it. If that&#8217;s the case, it should not
have been difficult for Gareth himself to get a look at the letter, or at least
to have his father confirm what he reported seeing in the letter.

The next logical thing for Gareth to do would be to actually go to the Attorney
General&#8217;s Office and to demonstrate the radian exercise for the officials
there. If people in the office were impressed by the information,
Gareth&#8217;s own word would have carried a lot more weight with the
Department of Justice behind it.

Instead, Gareth experiences amnesia about where the radian clue came from.

Except his dad, of course. Hugh Penn, who had a college degree and had been a
cryptographer during his time in the Army during World War II, figured to be
the most intelligent person associated with police agencies that Gareth could
break the news to. But Gareth, for some reason, wants to disassociate Hugh Penn
from what&#8217;s going on. I wonder why?

If your father had a career in law enforcement, and you had what you thought
was significant information about a high profile case, wouldn&#8217;t your
reflex be to contact the police first? Wouldn&#8217;t contacting a big city
newspaper tend to make it look as if you were just seeking publicity? In other
words, wouldn&#8217;t calling the newspaper at that stage be counterproductive?

If Gareth were not going to take his discovery to the Attorney General&#8217;s
Office, the next most-likely place to go would have been SFPD, a big city
police agency. Instead, he visits the Napa Sheriff&#8217;s Office, which is
sufficiently backward technologically that David Fincher&#8217;s movie ZZooddiiaacc
has the Bill Armstrong character offering to fax what information SFPD has, and
Ken Narlow telling him that they don&#8217;t have a fax machine.

He chooses Napa instead of SFPD because a smaller agency figures to be less
sophisticated, and his own comfort level will be higher. As the FBI has pointed
out in their profiling, serial killers tend to strike first in familiar
territory, where they feel the most comfortable. This would also apply to a
publicity agent for a serial killer who has to weather the storm of suspicion
he will face when he first comes forward.

Remember: Gareth SAYS he called SFPD first that Friday night, but we have no
way of knowing that for sure. That's the advantage of talking to a desk
sergeant instead of the Homicide Detail; there'd be no follow-up on the call,
assuming he made it in the first place.

The following Friday morning, Gareth talked to Ken Narlow again, this time in
the presence of several other Zodiac investigators. When it became clear that
Gareth himself was under suspicion, he did his best to talk his way out of it.

In other words, Gareth had talked about the Zodiac with Ken Narlow for three
hours the previous Monday, and the topic of his father, Hugh Penn, who worked
for both the California Highway Patrol and the Attorney General's Office, and
who was the source of his information, never came up. Does this make sense to
anyone? It only makes sense if you assume Gareth WANTED to be a suspect, and
wanted Ken Narlow to go through the motions of clearing him so he would
subsequently be free to disseminate his information without further suspicion.

I can hear the reader muttering to himself, &#8220;Well, Gareth couldn&#8217;t
expect his dad to divulge specific information about a letter that hadn&#8217;t
been released to the public.&#8221;

Maybe not. But Gareth&#8217;s dad DID divulge something a lot more sensitive:
the actual symbols of The Cryptogram as they were sent by the killer.



Granted, Gareth never mentions where he got the symbols (another example of
disconnect), but I&#8217;m assuming he didn&#8217;t get them from Ken Narlow.
The only employee of a police (actually prosecutorial) agency likely to give
him that information was Hugh Penn.

I say the same thing about Gareth Penn that I&#8217;ve been saying about
Michael O&#8217;Hare: at what point does his behavior become so bizarre that a
Zodiac hobbyist begins questioning it?

In the early 1990s, I asked Captain Roy Conway of Vallejo PD point-blank if The
Mt. Diablo Letter included a second page with the suggestion Gareth mentions.
His answer, after a moment's pause, was Yes, which is why I quoted
Gareth&#8217;s version of the letter in my books . . . but I now suspect Roy
Conway misunderstood my question. He may have thought I meant the Phillips 66
map page.

SFPD has passed around those letters for decades. Some of them have found their
way to the homes of police administrators. Is it conceivable that a single page
from a letter sent in June 1970 would still be kept secret when everything else
has been made public?



If SFPD really took the radian angle seriously, and had kept Page 2 secret for
that reason, would they have released the last page of The Mikado Letter? If
police agencies really took the radian angle seriously, wouldn't they have
immediately ushered Gareth Penn into an interrogation room as soon as he walked
in, instead of giving him the bum's rush out the door?

It's 2012, and a single page from a Zodiac letter hasn't been published, but
the contents of that page have been made public, something the police would
have known about since late 1980. Police would also have known who the leak
was--Hugh Penn. Hugh Penn was also presumably the source for the original
version of The Cryptogram to be found in TTiimmeess 1177, presented here with the
deviations from the versions published in the newspapers:



One would think that, if police agencies were going to object to the
publication of anything, they'd have objected to the original version of The
Cryptogram being published. After all, we have no way of knowing how seriously
they took the radian clue, except for Ken Narlow's poker-faced reaction to it
when Gareth Penn showed it to him. But we know the police took The Cryptogram
seriously, since they went to the trouble of even checking out Donald Harden
when he came forward with a solution to the revised Cryptogram.

It's possible that an unpublished page from a Zodiac letter has somehow slipped
through the cracks, but it seems more likely that, in 1980, Gareth Penn and his
cohorts decided that merely citing the PS in a follow-up letter wasn't going to
be convincing enough to the average person. The hint about placing the radian
had to be there in the same letter with the Phillips 66 map and code, and the
hint had to actually suggest placing a radian on Mt. Diablo instead of just
saying that the code itself concerns radians.

He must have decided that the radian PS was too far removed from The Mt. Diablo
Letter for readers to make the connection, so he fabricated the part about
&#8220;something interesting&#8221; in a second page, covering himself by
filtering the information through his father.

Citations Without Sources

Gareth mentions becoming a Zodiac suspect because he showed up in possession of
knowledge he wasn&#8217;t supposed to have.

If you look at the two most important insights he makes in TTiimmeess 1177, both are
based on information he couldn't have gotten, since it doesn't exist.

Maybe he means he was checking ALL the biographical dictionaries there. If so,
he never tells us which SPECIFIC dictionary he finds the Berta Margoulies
reference in.

Professional academics and degreed librarians normally cite books by giving a
title, author, year of publication, and publishing house.

Note that Gareth doesn't even supply a title.

He was either out to lunch at the most critical moment in his book . . . or
he's smirking at us.



The Atlas Peak Fire

On page 48 of TTiimmeess 1177, Gareth Penn finally mentions another specific date when
an event in his book takes place. On June 22, 1981, an unknown arsonist started
a massive forest fire in Napa, California, an event that became known as The
Atlas Peak Fire.

Note Gareth's detailed description of the fire itself:

Mr. Bressler was surprised that I believed The Atlas Peak Fire was started by
the Zodiac killer. What struck Bressler most about the blaze was the strategic
way in which the fire was SET, taking into account the probable movements of
the firefighters. Here's a passage from an online paper about that fire:

I originally read TTiimmeess 1177 in 1987. I'm sure I was one of the book's first
handful of readers. But I didn't talk to Darrell Bressler until 1990. So what
Gareth said about how the blaze was started, I took at face value.

Gareth's version of events suggested that the same sort of device depicted in
the Zodiac's Bus Bomb Diagram of November 9, 1969, or in The 13-Character
Cipher Letter of April 20, 1970, perhaps in miniature, was used to ignite The
Atlas Peak Fire.



There's only one problem with his observation. As Darrell Bressler pointed out
to me 22 years ago, The Atlas Peak Fire WASN'T started by a string of
mechanical bombs containing timers.

The Atlas Peak Fire was started by an arsonist or arsonists using a very simple
device.

Darrell was loath to describe the actual device used, for obvious reasons, but
what he meant was something along the lines of a packet of matchbooks with a
cigarette as the fuse.

_C_i_g_a_r_e_t_t_e_ _F_u_s_e

So . . . where did Gareth get his information about mechanical bombs, when the
head investigator for The Atlas Peak Fire says otherwise? I had several pages
of illustrations for The Atlas Peak Fire in my physical book from 1990, one
article from The New York Times, none of which mentioned mechanical bombs
starting the fire.

How could Gareth Penn--how could ANYONE--make a mistake of that magnitude? How
could you suggest such a complex explanation for something when you cite no
source for the information, and when the state investigator says there WERE no
bombs?

I know what Mike Butterfield's going to say about this. How DARE Ray Grant
question Mike's former mentor Gareth Penn?

Well, Mike, I'm just pointing out a pattern here:

We're 48 pages into TTiimmeess 1177, and Gareth Penn has already dropped THREE
bombshells:


1. "Something interesting" would be found if a radian were placed on Mt.
Diablo.

2. Michael O'Hare's name was found in a biographical directory including his
mother.

3. Nine mechanical bombs containing timers ignited The Atlas Peak Fire.


Those bombshells are breathtaking; but when you check the original sources, you
find that:


1. Gareth cites a 2nd page of text in The Mt. Diablo Letter, when there IS no
2nd page of text.

2. Gareth cites a book at The Napa City & County Library, when there IS no such
book.

3. Gareth cites bombs w/timers igniting The Atlas Peak Fire, when no such
devices were found.


So let me ask my pet question again:

At what point does Gareth Penn's behavior (and Michael O'Hare's behavior, for
that matter) become so BIZARRE that a Zodiac hobbyist will actually begin to
question it?

Here are some opinions along those lines, voiced a decade before Ray Grant went
online:

Note that I'm only 48 pages into the text, and TTiimmeess 1177 is 380 pages long . . .


As the reader may have noticed, I've consolidated articles on this site to make
it simpler for me to add material. Doing that has made the articles themselves
a bit more difficult to scroll through, but I think serious readers would
rather see more content, even if it makes the site clunkier. One downside of
this approach is that I will be adding material to articles that have already
been posted, so it's up to the reader to check back later for updates.

In other words: TO BE CONTINUED . . .
