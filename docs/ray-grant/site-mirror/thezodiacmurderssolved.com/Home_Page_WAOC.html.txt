Hi! And welcome to the website edition of my book about the Zodiac killer!

If you're coming here for the first time, I recommend taking a look at my other
website, _Z_o_d_i_a_c_ _K_i_l_l_e_r_ _T_i_m_e_l_i_n_e, when you get the chance. That site
concentrates on conventional aspects of the Zodiac murders, and, as such, is a
kind of necessary bridge between the standard True Crime accounts of the Zodiac
events you'll find elsewhere and the cryptographic approach you'll find here.
ZKT.com is currently under construction, but I hope to have it up and running
soon.

I will be pasting the book onto this site a chapter at a time, as time permits.
This allows me to sidestep the obstacle of actually finishing the book prior to
publishing it! People can come to the site and digest as little or as much of
it as they wish, and then come back a few days later and possibly find more.

This book is meant to be read in sequence. If you try reading it out of
sequence, it won't make sense to you. Trust me. So resist the urge to skip
ahead. You are being baby-stepped through a relatively complex series of
suppositions and explications, a narrative which is difficult enough to swallow
if you do it in the recommended order.

This book doesn't have a single crucial point to build toward, like a drum
roll. It's an example of Argument By Attrition. So meet that argument halfway
by digesting it in the recommended order. The further into the book you get,
the more this strategy will make sense to you.
