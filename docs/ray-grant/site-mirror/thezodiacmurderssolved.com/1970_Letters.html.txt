April 1970

The two April 1970 letters, though relatively short, contain clues to the
Zodiac killer&#8217;s name and the identity of a recent victim (Shelly
Holmboe), remind us of a geometric metaphor for revealing that identity
(180DEG), hint at the burial location of the next Zodiac victim (Donna Lass in
Dragon Plaza), and specify the WHERE and WHEN of The Terminus Event still 19
years in the future.

Because neither letter was mailed immediately following a murder event (if
you&#8217;re going by my own time-line, the most recent murder had occurred on
March 29th), one may assume the content of these letters was fixed at the
outset.

In other words, the Zodiac killer wasn&#8217;t commenting on recent police
activity, as he did in the letters following Paul Stine&#8217;s murder.

Keep in mind that the murders of Shelly Holmboe, Robert Salem, Donna Lass, and
Joan Webster were intended to be non-public events, in the sense that no living
person would see him commit them, and he would not acknowledge them afterward.

This is essentially what the Zodiac killer means when he says, on page 1 of the
November 9, 1969 Bus Bomb Diagram Letter, that

II sshhaallll nnoo lloonnggeerr aannnnoouunnccee ttoo aannyyoonnee

tthheeyy sshhaallll llooookk lliikkee rroouuttiinnee

aa ffeeww ffaakkee aacccciiddeennttss,, eettcc

Perhaps the most significant information, found in the second letter, is the
suggestion that The Terminus Event will include a BLAST of some kind.

Since we know that event was at least partly scheduled for The MIT Tower,
pictured in Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s maiden journal article in 1967, a
BLAST would suggest an explosion, perhaps one large enough to level the
structure.



Could the Zodiac killer really bring down an entire building?

We of the post-9/11 world have recurring nightmares of skyscrapers crumbling in
criminal catastrophes, but in 1970 few people (and few engineers, for that
matter) would have imagined such things were possible.

On the other hand, as an engineer and architect, Michael O&#8217;Hare would
have been familiar with the methods of demolition for just about any edifice.

And, on page 4 of the letter quoted above, the Zodiac killer does mention an
ammonium nitrate fertilizer bomb of the type that would, in 1995, be used to
bring down The Murrah Federal Building in Oklahoma City.


April 1970 Letters Facts

The April 1970 letters are the 9th and 10th mailings in The Bay Area.

On April 20, 1970, the Zodiac killer mailed The 13-Character Cipher Letter:



. . . and, on a second page containing another bomb diagram,

PPSS II hhooppee yyoouu hhaavvee ffuunn ttrryyiinngg

On April 28, 1970, the Zodiac killer mailed his second commercial greeting
card, commonly called "The Dragon Card", but I'm going to call it "The Little
Dragon Card" for reasons I'll explain in a future chapter:



. . . and then, on the back,

II wwoouulldd lliikkee ttoo sseeee ssoommee nniiccee ZZooddiiaacc bbuuttoonnss wwaannddeerriinngg aabboouutt ttoowwnn..

Isn&#8217;t it odd that he TWICE misspells a word that he also correctly spells
elsewhere in the letter?
It&#8217;s almost as if he&#8217;s doing it on purpose!

My Name

The 13-Character Cipher purports to reveal the Zodiac killer&#8217;s name.

I think this is accurate, but not in the way people think.

As I said before, I have different names depending on who&#8217;s talking to
me.

I&#8217;m &#8216;Raymond&#8217; to my family, I&#8217;m &#8216;Ray&#8217; to my
friends (a slightly smaller group!), I&#8217;m &#8216;Grant&#8217; to those
addressing me officially, or at least &#8216;Mr. Grant&#8217;. And I&#8217;m
also &#8216;RG&#8217;.

Note that The Cryptogram is 24 lines of 17 columns.

Note that The 340 is 20 lines of 17 columns.

The 13-Character Cipher is 1 line of 13 columns.

The 32-Character Cipher is 2 lines of 17 and 15 columns.

If you eliminate all the lines of 17, what are you left with?

13, then 15.

What&#8217;s the 13th letter of the alphabet?

MM.

What&#8217;s the 15th letter of the alphabet?

OO.

What are Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s initials?


SH

But The 13-Character Cipher Letter also names someone else.

I said all the Zodiac ciphers could be decoded using the same letter values as
were used in The Cryptogram. Let&#8217;s translate The 13-Character Cipher that
way and see what we get:


WW EE EE DD 88SS 88HH 88 ??EE WW HH

Hmmm . . . two Ws! What a surprise!

And those first four letters sure look familiar, somehow!

WW EE EE DD
2233 ++ 55 ++ 55 ++ 44 == 3377

That's right. It's our old friend, 37!

"My name is . . . 3, followed by 7 decimal digits of pi."

And the reference is symmetrical, meaning two things at once: 3.1415926 spells
out an anagram of ZODIAC, and pi in binary spells out M.ERAHO.

By the way, I'm a little tired of hearing my Baby Block Cryptography called
'numerology' by people who obviously don't know what numerology is.

Here are a couple excerpts from the Wikipedia page on Numerology:

NNuummbbeerr ddeeffiinniittiioonnss
There are no set definitions for the meaning of specific digits. Common
examples include:_[_5_]
1. Individual. Aggressor. Yang.
2. Balance. Union. Receptive. Yin.
3. Communication/interaction. Neutrality.
4. Creation.
5. Action. Restlessness.
6. Reaction/flux. Responsibility.
7. Thought/consciousness.
8. Power/sacrifice.
9. Highest level of change.
Some lucky number combinations include:
    * 99 &#8212; doubly long in time, hence eternal; used in the name of a
      popular Chinese-American supermarket chain, _9_9_ _R_a_n_c_h_ _M_a_r_k_e_t.
    * 168 &#8212; road of prosperity or to be prosperous together literal
      translation is "continuing to be wealthy"&#8212; many premium-pay
      telephone numbers in _C_h_i_n_a begin with this number. It is also the name of
      a motel chain in China (Motel 168).
    * 518 &#8212; I will prosper, other variations include: 5189 (I will
      prosper for a long time), 516289 (I will get on a long, smooth prosperous
      road) and 5918 (I will soon prosper)
    * 814 &#8212; Similar to 168, this means "be wealthy, entire life". 148
      also implies the same meaning "entire life be wealthy".
    * 888 &#8212; Three times the prosperity, means "wealthy wealthy wealthy".
      (E.g., the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing were designated by the Chinese
      officials to begin on the most auspicious date possible to ensure the
      success of the Games for its hosts: August 8, 2008&#8212;on the 8th day,
      of the 8th month in the 8th year of the new millennium.)
    * 1314 &#8212; whole lifetime, existence.
    * 289 &#8212; This combination is quite straightforward: ease in finding
      enough luck/fortune and holding it for a long time. (2 is easy, 8 is
      fortune, 9 is enough and/or for a long time)

In other words, numerology is a system where numbers have a particular meaning
that's been assigned to them (usually within the context of a particular
culture). The numbers I cite as occurring over and over again in the Zodiac
literature have meaning ONLY as they apply to Michael O'Hare (e. g., his DOB),
or as an allusion to mathematical concepts like pi. The numbers are significant
as numbers, and within the context of The Zodiac Project.

WW EE EE DD 88SS 88HH 88 ??EE WW HH

As you can see, there&#8217;s a central &#8216;SH&#8217; which is flanked by 8-
balls.

Being &#8216;behind the 8-ball&#8217; traditionally means one is doomed.

I believe the &#8216;SH&#8217; referred to at the center is Shelly Holmboe.

The Zodiac killer often sends a follow-up letter 6 months after a murder, and
the April 20, 1970 letter would have been six months after the Shelly Holmboe
murder.

So this is a reminder that he did kill Shelly Holmboe.

He also says, in this very letter,

PPSS II hhooppee yyoouu hhaavvee ffuunn ttrryyiinngg
ttoo ffiigggguurree oouutt wwhhoo II kkiilllleedd..

I don&#8217;t think he could have been much more blatant than that.

EE WW HH
55 ++ 2233 ++ 88 == 3366

If going from 37 to 36 is a backward progression, it might make sense that one
sees SH (Shelly Holmboe) as a previous victim when one looks back.

If pi is represented by 37, but the entire line adds up to 73 (37+36), it might
suggest that, though ZODIAC is 3 followed by 7 decimal digits, his real name is
reversed within the binary form of pi (M.ERAHO).

Finally, if the whole line is 73, and The Zodiac Project begins as a halfway
point in Riverside, then the doubling of that value will get you to The End (73
x 2 = 146, just as "Seeger x2" is written at The End of The 18 Letters, Alan
Seeger having been born on 73rd Street).


Wizard Pairs

As Gareth Penn has pointed out, the word

WWIIZZAARRDD

is constructed entirely of pairs of letters which are the same distance from
the ends of the alphabet, and so for that reason, cancel each other out
cryptically.

AA BB CC DD EE FF GG HH II JJ KK LL MM
ZZ YY XX WW VV UU TT SS RR QQ PP OO NN

For this reason, Shelly Holmboe is a kind of living Wizard-pair.

Her initials are S-H, which would cancel each other out, using this system.

In that sense, she&#8217;s a natural target.


Six Months

Why would the Zodiac killer bring up Shelly Holmboe again, six months after her
murder? If he&#8217;s already claimed her as a victim with The Oakland PD phone
call, why mention her again?

For the same reason he sends letters in Riverside six months after the Cheri
Bates murder.

As I said in the Intro Section, 180DEG is a metaphor for a secret identity.

And six months is approximately 180 days.

So in six months, the Zodiac killer sends you another clue to his identity,
usually in the form of an acknowledgment of some aspect of one of his crimes.


Little Dragon Card

The Little Dragon Card of April 28, 1970, looks ahead to several events in the
future, one taking place in October that same year, the other in 1989.

The word &#8216;Dragon&#8217; is simply a reference to the storefront located
at 739 Clay Street in Chinatown, where Donna Lass, who is kidnapped and
probably murdered on September 6, 1970, will be buried on October 5, 1970.

The name of the Chinese storefront/business was DRAGON PLAZA (now DRAGON SEED).




On October 5, 1970, the Zodiac killer will bury Donna Lass&#8217;s body just
across the street from DRAGON PLAZA.



The Little Dragon Card is mailed six months prior to The Halloween Card of
October 27, 1970, which also references the burial.

So the mailing of April 20, 1970 looks back six months.

And the mailing of April 28, 1970 looks ahead six months.

The two letters behave like the Roman god Janus, looking in two different
directions at once, the faces 180DEG apart.


Blast

Let&#8217;s look at BLAST in alphabet numbers:

BB LL AA SS TT
22 ++ 1122 ++ 11 ++ 1199 ++ 2200 == 5544

BLAST is 54.

That&#8217;s interesting for two reasons.

Dragon Plaza was the site of Benchmark 54 of the United States Geological
Survey&#8217;s map of San Francisco; it&#8217;s embedded in a wall beside the
storefront (my friend Ricardo says it's still there, by the way, but painted-
over).

So the address has geological significance.

But 54 is also the building number of The Earth Sciences Building at MIT, which
is also called The MIT Tower, which is also designated, on campus, as Building
54.




Let me suggest that that&#8217;s what the Zodiac killer had in store for the
MIT Tower on Friday, August 11, 1989--a BLAST.

By the way, if Michael O'Hare DID somehow blow up Building 54, what would be
the result?

""WWiinndd WWhhiissttlleess TThhrroouugghh MMIITT TToowweerr""??

So the title of his maiden journal article wouldn't just be a grad student's
analysis of a design flaw in a prominent building.

It would be a bold prediction, made by one of the most notorious criminals of
the 20th century, of a terrible act of domestic terrorism approximately 23
years in the future.

By the way, it's worth noting that if my reading of The 18 Letters is correct,
and the area of The MIT Tower targeted by the BLAST was Room 929, that the
result would be (assuming the explosive charge was powerful enough) to blow the
building literally in half (since The Tower itself is 18 stories high). Thus,
The MIT Tower itself, in its final form (before the later demolition of the
ruins), would represent his having cut his life CLEAN in half.


P. R.

Note how important it is to the Zodiac killer that all his letters be published
for the public to see. Note that I&#8217;ve illustrated, here in my book, that
the murders and letters and other information are, for the most part,
sequential in nature.

If the newspapers suddenly decide to hold back letters (which they do after the
June 1970 Mt. Diablo Letter), the public will only get a partial view of the
puzzle.

Keep in mind, also, as the David Fincher movie ZZooddiiaacc makes clear in
what&#8217;s intended to be a comical sequence, that The Cryptogram was solved
not by the FBI, CIA, NSA, or any other intelligence agency, but in the
breakfast nook of Donald and Bettye Harden.

At least, that's what the police want us to believe.

The Zodiac killer clearly has more faith in the general public than he does in
the police and newspapers&#8212;perhaps with good reason.


Buton

Speaking of publicity, in The Little Dragon Card the Zodiac killer for the
first time asked people to wear buttons in his honor&#8212;

II wwoouulldd lliikkee
ttoo sseeee ssoommee nniiccee ZZooddiiaacc bbuuttoonnss
wwaannddeerriinngg aabboouutt ttoowwnn..

That&#8217;s unusually whimsical for the Zodiac killer. Oddly enough, he would
also talk about wanting to see people wearing buttons in the next three
letters&#8212;in four letters in all, spanning a time period from April 28,
1970 to July 25, 1970.

33 ++ 3311 ++ 3300 ++ 2255 == 8899

That&#8217;s a span of 89 days.

And we&#8217;re talking about a Blast that will occur in &#8217;89.

He also misspells the word BUTTON twice in the first letter.

BB UU TT OO NN
22 ++ 2211 ++ 2200 ++ 1155 ++ 1144 == 7722

By alphabet numbers, BUTON is 72.

BB UU TT OO NN
11000000 000011 11 111111 1100 == 44222222

By Morse/binary, BUTON is 4222.

Since the BLAST refers to Building 54 on the MIT campus, The Earth Sciences
Building, maybe these two numbers, 72 and 4222, somehow have to do with that
building?

7722 44222222

The earth coordinates of The MIT Tower are roughly

7711DDEEGG WW&&nnbbsspp;; 4422DDEEGG 2222&&##88221177;; NN

It&#8217;s not a perfect match, but that would have been hard to come by, since
you&#8217;d have to get one coordinate from alphabet numbers and the other from
Morse/binary, and you&#8217;d have to get both numbers from the same word.

BUTON was the closest they could get . . . and it&#8217;s very close.

The Mt. Diablo Letter

The Mt. Diablo Letter of June 26, 1970 and its follow-up, The Mikado Letter of
July 25, 1970, are arguably the most-discussed letters in the Zodiac killer
canon, containing as they do what many Zodiac buffs consider the most important
clue to his puzzle: The Mt. Diablo Radian.


Mt. Diablo Facts

On June 26, 1970, the Zodiac killer mailed a new letter to The San Francisco
Chronicle, consisting of a single page of text . . .



. . . and an annotated section of a Phillips 66 service station map.



Magic

I've mentioned in previous chapters that the Zodiac killer's intent was to
reveal his identity in everything he did, and that the disguise he used most
often was misdirection.

The best magician is the one who keeps his hands in full view at all times, but
who still manages to fool us by getting us to LOOK THE WRONG WAY while the real
action of the trick takes place elsewhere.

The reader may remember the hustler/magician in the movie Restoration. All he
used was three playing cards, which looked quite tattered, in doing his trick.
One of the cards was a queen, the other two were aces, and the magician would
show each card to the customer (played by Robert Downey, Jr., of all people!),
dropping them one by one onto a faded checkerboard, and then say, &#8220;Find
the lady!&#8221;

_hh_tt_tt_pp_::_//_//_ww_ww_ww_.._yy_oo_uu_tt_uu_bb_ee_.._cc_oo_mm_//_ww_aa_tt_cc_hh_??_vv_==_oo_cc_uu_dd_ee_pp_yy_OO_99_00_YY_&&_ff_ee_aa_tt_uu_rr_ee_==_rr_ee_ll_aa_tt_ee_dd_ 

Sometimes, LOOKING THE WRONG WAY means staring DIRECTLY at the clues, but
looking the wrong way AT them. The Zodiac killer uses TWO queens (Donna Lass
and Joan Webster) but one ace (misdirection).

Perhaps the best example of that misdirection is to be found in The Mt. Diablo
Letter.

At the bottom of the letter, the Zodiac killer says

TThhee MMaapp ccoouupplleedd wwiitthh tthhiiss
ccooddee wwiillll tteellll yyoouu wwhheerree tthhee
bboommbb iiss sseett.. YYoouu hhaavvee uunnttiillll
nneexxtt FFaallll ttoo ddiigg iitt uupp..

Does the reader notice anything ambiguous about that statement?

For the past 40 years, readers of this letter have taken 'The Map' to mean the
service station map, and 'this code' to mean the 32 cipher symbols at the
bottom of the page.

But . . . since he doesn't specify which is which . . . what if he
DOESN&#8217;T mean that?

What if 'The Map' is actually the 32 cipher symbols?

And what if 'this code' is actually the section of the service station map?

Ridiculous, you say?

Why? Because the Zodiac killer didn&#8217;t TELL US he was trying to misdirect
us that way?

Well, no. Of course not!

Just as a hustler/magician doesn't look up in mid-trick and say, "Notice what
my hands are doing over here . . ."

The intent was to reveal his identity to us, but in such a way that we missed
getting the message after all. That's where the fun lies in any puzzle. You put
the solution in front of the viewer, but he has to stumble through a maze of
misdirection to find it.

The Zodiac killer's genius, if you want to call it that, is that the entire
world is still trapped in that maze, more than 40 years after the mailing!

32-Character Cipher

How is The 32-Character Cipher a map?

I&#8217;ve stated that the Zodiac killer murdered two women, his final two
individual victims (Donna Lass and Joan Webster) in order to place them in
specific locations on the landscape.

The 32-Character Cipher is a map IF the positioning of the cipher symbols
somehow locates one or both of those victims somewhere on planet Earth.

Let&#8217;s go back to The 13-Character Cipher, mailed April 20, 1970.



Remember: I said that the central two symbols, K-M, flanked by 8-balls, stand
for the same thing they stood for in The Cryptogram&#8212;S-H. Let's translate
the entire cipher that way:

WW EE EE DD ((88--bbaallll)) SS ((88--bbaallll)) HH ((88--bbaallll)) ?? EE WW HH

Thus, Shelly Holmboe (S-H) is positioned in The 13-Character Cipher in a
central location. There&#8217;s a reason for putting her there, which I will
discuss in the next chapter where I review all four ciphers. For now, all the
reader needs to know is that the SH isn&#8217;t just thematically the
centerpiece of that cipher; it is also physically the central element.

With that in mind, let&#8217;s look at The 32-Character Cipher:



If a pair of initials can stand for a person&#8217;s physical location in
space, certainly a single symbol can do the same thing. But which symbol in The
32 is the best candidate for that role?



This is the Greek letter Omega, upper and lower case. I find it interesting
that the lower case form closely resembles the English letter W, the 23rd
letter of our alphabet.

As Gareth Penn states several times in his book, Times 17, the Greek letter
Omega appears just once in the entire Zodiac literature, as the 13th character
(coincidentally, we just had a cipher that was 13 characters in total) of the
first line (which consists of 17 characters) of The 32. Gareth furthermore
associates that character with Joan Webster, whom he calls the Zodiac
killer&#8217;s last victim.

If the reader has been paying attention all this time, he&#8217;s probably
already tired of hearing that I predicted a criminal catastrophe in 1989 that
would combine aspects of The Oklahoma City Bombing (a building demolition) and
The Texas Tower Sniper Incident of August 1, 1966 (a mass murder sniper event),
the pair of which I refer to as The Terminus Event.

The Terminus Event's venues were spelled out in the final 18 letters of the
Zodiac&#8217;s Cryptogram, and scheduled in the word VALLEJO atop the car door
message, for Friday, August 11, 1989.

In other words, I expected the Zodiac killer to go out with a very big BANG.

If Joan Webster was really his final victim, this was obviously wrong.

But was I wrong?

Gareth Penn makes note of the letter Omega in The 32, and says that the Zodiac
killer meant for it to refer to Joan Webster, who was intended to be the last
victim. Thus, his use of the last Greek letter, Omega, which is often used to
designate something final (as in &#8220;The Alpha and The Omega&#8221;, which
means &#8220;The First and The Last&#8221;).

In other words, Omega stands for Joan Webster BECAUSE the Zodiac killer
designated her as the final victim. But, since we&#8217;ve deciphered The 18
Letters, we know that&#8217;s wrong.

Picket Fence

Let&#8217;s look at something else Gareth says and does in Times 17.

On page 182 of Times 17, Gareth discusses a possible location for Joan
Webster&#8217;s body.

Gareth looks around the state of Massachusetts for possible burial places, and
notices an area near Concord called Goose Pond on the map. The positioning of
the two letter &#8216;O&#8217;s on the map is crucial. When he drives out to
investigate the area, he sees that a picket fence has been constructed in a
circle exactly where one of the &#8216;O&#8217;s would be on the map. Gareth
has a group of his volunteers dig down several feet, and they come up with
nothing but tree roots.

This is an example of the Zodiac killer literally acting out a deciphering
technique. As I&#8217;ll demonstrate in a moment, he also does it when he
murders Shelly Holmboe. But let&#8217;s take a look at that picket fence that
so fascinated Gareth.

JJooaann WWeebbsstteerr

JJ WW

1100 2233

As you can see, Joan Webster&#8217;s initials are J-W.

By alphabet numbers, this is 10-23.

The number 1023 has a peculiar property in binary math: it consists entirely of
1-digits.

11111111111111111111 == 11002233

1023 is what is called, in binary math, a &#8220;picket fence&#8221; number.

Here are some other examples:


11 == 11
1111 == 33
111111 == 77
11111111 == 1155
1111111111 == 3311

Essentially, a picket fence number is a power of two minus one.

1024 is 2 to the 10th power. 1023 is 2 to the 10th, minus one.

What&#8217;s the significance of a picket fence number?

In this case, it allows Gareth Penn to make a demonstration, in the physical
world, of a deciphering technique. He has his volunteers travel to the picket
fence enclosing a circle of ground at Goose Pond. The fence itself, a foot high
and seven feet in diameter, was undoubtedly put there by Gareth Penn and
Michael O&#8217;Hare. In any case, the volunteers dig down inside it to about
four feet, finding nothing. In the book, his helpers dissipate in disgust.

But oddly enough, Gareth&#8217;s point has been made. If you really want to
find Joan Webster&#8217;s burial location, you have to dig down inside the
picket fence.

The picket fence, in this case, is Joan Webster&#8217;s (JW&#8217;s) name.

JJ OO AA NN WW EE BB SS TT EE RR
00111111 111111 0011 1100 001111 00 11000000 000000 11 00 001100

OO MM EE GG AA

As you can see, the word OMEGA can be found inside Joan Webster&#8217;s name,
simply by converting that name to Morse code and redividing the digits (or for
that matter, the dots and dashes). OMEGA is actually part of JOAN W, so her
name differs from David Faraday&#8217;s (EASTER being found entirely inside
DAVID) and Darlene Ferrin (EASTER being found entirely inside FERRIN) in that
sense.

Curt Rowlett made the amazing observation, in August, that when Ray Grant finds
words like EASTER inside the names of victims, it&#8217;s &#8220;probably just
coincidence&#8221;. Wow! What intellectual rigor! I can&#8217;t even hope to
match Curt&#8217;s amazing precision of thought, but I will point out that
Omega consists of 11 characters in Morse code (just like EASTER).

OO MM EE GG AA
111111 1111 00 111100 0011

1111111111001111000011

Let&#8217;s do the math, shall we, Curt?

A string of 1 digit has 2 to the first power, or 2 different possible
configurations.

11or00

A string of 2 digits has 2 to the second power, or 4 different possible
configurations.

0011 0000 1100 1111

So the number of possibilities is always the power of 2 of that number of
digits.

Three digits is 2 to the third, or 8 possibilities.

Four digits is 2 to the fourth, or 16 possibilities, and so forth.

A string of 11 digits will have 2 to the 11th number of
possibilities&#8212;2,048.

The name Joan Webster itself contains 27 characters.

JJ OO AA NN WW EE BB SS TT EE RR
00111111 111111 0011 1100 001111 00 11000000 000000 11 00 001100

You can run an 11-digit string 17 times through a name 27 characters long.

That means the string has a 17/2,048 chance of showing up in a name this long.

That means OMEGA will show up about .8% of the time in names as long as Joan
Webster&#8217;s.

If the Zodiac killed a thousand women . . . he might get 8 or 9 OMEGAs, purely
by chance.

I think that proves Curt correct--it's "probably just coincidence".

How does this apply to our examination of The 32?

Omega indicates the exact burial location of Joan Webster, when that first line
of The 32 is superimposed on a map of the Greater Boston area. I&#8217;m not
going to demonstrate that in this part of the book, since discussion of the
burial location more properly belongs in a later chapter.

I will also point out that there&#8217;s another symbol in The 32 that stands
for a buried victim, which I&#8217;ll discuss it in the NEXT chapter (you have
until then to dig it up).

I will explain how the murder of Shelly Holmboe demonstrates, in the physical
world, the elimination of a Wizard-pair, and I&#8217;ll do that in THIS
chapter, but during my discussion of the service station map.

In the meantime, I want to emphasize that The 32 is itself a map, and not
really a code.

Which tells us, by a process of elimination, that the service station map
isn&#8217;t a map, but a code.

Service Station

If the service station map is really a code, what are the components of that
code?


1, the reference to Magnetic North

2, the clock face drawn on Mt. Diablo

3, its name, Phillips 66


One objection to the use of the service station map is that it doesn&#8217;t
contain one of the Zodiac murder sites (Blue Rock Springs). This fact has been
offered to PROVE that the Zodiac killer didn&#8217;t intend a radian to be
drawn on the map.

Instead, it is a hint that the document itself (the Phillips 66 map) was never
intended to be used as a map in the first place. But the confusion over map &
code is all part of the problem.

Magnetic North

Let&#8217;s start with the reference to Magnetic North.

For starters, the Zodiac killer doesn't actually say ANYTHING about Magnetic
North.



He says, "0 is to be set to Mag. N."

For 40 years (actually for just the past dozen or so, since internet message
boards didn't exist before then), people have ASSUMED the Zodiac killer meant
'Magnetic North' when he said 'Mag. N.'. And there's nothing wrong with that
assumption, but it IS an assumption, isn't it?

I'm just glad I'm not the only one around here making assumptions!

Ed Neil told Jake Wark, "Z never said anything about using murder sites to plot
a radian."

Well, he never said &#8216;Magnetic North&#8217; either, Ed.

This reminds me of the old B&M Baked Beans commercial from the 1970s: &#8220;Ed
Neil, 45 years old, and he&#8217;s never had a baked bean.&#8221; Ed looks up
from his plate of beans in consternation. &#8220;Those are STEAMED beans, Ed!
Look at the can!&#8221; A hand from offscreen shoves the label in Ed&#8217;s
face. &#8220;See the word &#8216;baked&#8217; anywhere???&#8221;



I&#8217;ve tried B&M Baked Beans; I prefer steamed beans myself, but then,
I&#8217;m used to the feeling of having been right all along.

Anyway, that&#8217;s what I say here: see the words &#8216;Magnetic
North&#8217; anywhere?

But what could the phrase, "0 is to be set to Mag. N." mean, if it's not a
reference to Magnetic North? Note, by the way, that the Zodiac capitalizes the
'M' and the 'N' . . . even though if you look up magnetic north, you'll notice
that neither word is capitalized.

We'll come back to this in a moment.

Compass

Since, as I&#8217;ve suggested any number of times, the Zodiac killer is into
symmetry, let&#8217;s assume that he wants it BOTH ways. So let's go with the
common assumption:

"0 is to be set to Magnetic North."

Why would the Zodiac killer be telling us this? Since the declination is
variable over time and dependent on the specific location, we can do all the
calculating we want and we still won&#8217;t get a specific value that remains
the same over time.

However, it is worth noting that United States Geological Survey maps contain
information used to calculate the declination; service station maps
don&#8217;t. This is another hint that the service station map isn&#8217;t
intended to be used as a map. If one uses a USGS map instead, one will find
that it contains benchmarks (such as BM 54 at 739 Clay Street in Chinatown).

A more convincing application for magnetic north is that it allows us to set
our compass.

What is a compass, by the way? A compass is an instrument that LOOKS like a
watch, and shares many attributes of a watch&#8212;it contains a circular dial,
and its findings can be expressed in minutes and seconds.

However, a compass normally allows us to locate ourselves in SPACE; a watch
allows us to locate ourselves in TIME. We know that a compass can also be used
to calculate time:

_h_t_t_p_:_/_/_w_w_w_._e_x_p_l_o_r_a_t_o_r_i_u_m_._e_d_u_/_s_c_i_e_n_c_e___e_x_p_l_o_r_e_r_/_s_u_n_c_l_o_c_k_._h_t_m_l

This would hint that a watch can also be used to locate us in SPACE, which it
can if it has a circular dial (i. e., if it&#8217;s not digital), and I think
this is what the Zodiac intended.

Clock Face

Why put a clock face on a map?



Let me suggest that it is one side of yet another symmetrical statement.

If the Zodiac killer can put a clock face on a map (or on what appears to be a
map) . . . can he also put a map on a clock face?



Why not???




By putting a clock face on the map (or what appears to be a map), the Zodiac
killer is reminding us that he's about to claim another victim. This letter was
sent on June 26, 1970; Donna Lass disappeared on September 6, 1970. The murder
will occur at the place (Lake Tahoe) suggested by a map put on a clock face,
the Timex watch stopped at 12:22 left beside the body of Cheri Bates.

Found Objects

There are, both in art and literature, such things as &#8220;found
objects&#8221;.

_h_t_t_p_:_/_/_e_n_._w_i_k_i_p_e_d_i_a_._o_r_g_/_w_i_k_i_/_F_o_u_n_d___o_b_j_e_c_t

Vladimir Nabokov, in Lolita, refers to Dolores Haze&#8217;s class roster as a
&#8220;poem&#8221;; the technical term for this use of the roster (if it were a
real class roster and not fiction) is "found poem". Perhaps the most famous
example of a &#8220;found poem&#8221; is John Lennon&#8217;s &#8220;Being For
The Benefit of Mr. Kite&#8221;, a song from the Sergeant Pepper album which
consists largely of phrases from a Victorian poster John had bought in January
1967.

_h_t_t_p_:_/_/_w_w_w_._y_o_u_t_u_b_e_._c_o_m_/_w_a_t_c_h_?_v_=_K_h_s_n_-_n_X_B_x_s_0

The idea of "found objects" in art goes back at least to the Dadaists such as
Marcel Duchamp:

"The creative act is not performed by the artist alone; the spectator brings
the work in contact with the external world by deciphering and interpreting its
inner qualifications and thus adds his contribution to the creative act."


Duchamp took an actual urinal and gave it a label: "Fountain".




Andy Warhol painted Campbell&#8217;s Soup cans.



Roy Lichtenstein blew up panels from pop comics (sometimes literally).



The Phillips 66 service station map is an example of a found object in the
Zodiac literature. It doesn&#8217;t originate with him, it&#8217;s just part of
the environment and normally used for another purpose, but he makes annotations
on it and thus makes it an artifact of The Zodiac Project.

Shelly Holmboe Meridian

Shelly Holmboe was murdered on Sunday, October 19, 1969. Like the two other
Sunday victims (Cheri Bates and Robert Salem), she was stabbed and nearly
decapitated. As you can see from the USGS map, Peony Lane is a block or so
south of The Mt. Diablo Meridian, and runs parallel to it. I suspect the baby,
who was kidnapped by the Zodiac, was found on or very near The Mt. Diablo
Meridian.



Shelly Holmboe&#8217;s name has an unusual property. Because the first two
letters of her first name are SH, and her initials are SH, her name has a
crossword characteristic similar to the crossword in The Halloween Card; she is
SH in two directions at once, both North/South and East/West.

SSHHeellllyy
HHoollmmbbooee

SSHH
HH

Note also that SH, Heart-Stoppingly, consists entirely of 0s in Morse/binary,
seven of them:

SS HH
000000 00000000

In Dante&#8217;s Inferno, the crime punished in Circle 7 is murder.

Thus, Shelly Holmboe is an appropriate murder victim.

I suspect this is at least partly why the Zodiac killer chose her as the Wizard
victim, in addition to her proximity to Mt. Diablo. He could not reasonably
have dumped her body on VABM 3849 itself, which is the intersection of The Mt.
Diablo Base Line and The Mt. Diablo Meridian, so he was limited to using either
The Mt. Diablo Base Line OR The Mt. Diablo Meridian, and chose the latter. He
had to use a residential area where the murder could merely seem heinous but
not otherwise call attention to itself.

But why commit the murder in the first place?

Living Wizard

Just in case the reader has forgotten about Wizard Pairs, here's what I said
about them earlier:

WWIIZZAARRDD

is constructed entirely of pairs of letters which are the same distance from
the ends of the alphabet, and so for that reason, cancel each other out
cryptically.

11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 1100 1111 1122 1133
AA BB CC DD EE FF GG HH II JJ KK LL MM
ZZ YY XX WW VV UU TT SS RR QQ PP OO NN

For this reason, Shelly Holmboe is a kind of living Wizard Pair.

Her initials are S-H, which would cancel each other out, using this system.

In that sense, she&#8217;s a natural target.

8-Ball

Incidentally, note that H/S is the 8th such Wizard Pair in the alphabet.

11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99 1100 1111 1122 1133
AA BB CC DD EE FF GG HH II JJ KK LL MM
ZZ YY XX WW VV UU TT SS RR QQ PP OO NN

Note, also, that the central 'SH' in The 13-Character Cipher, when the symbols
are translated using the same values we find in The Cryptogram, is flanked by
8-balls.


WW EE EE DD ((88--bbaallll)) SS ((88--bbaallll)) HH ((88--bbaallll)) ?? EE WW HH


Coincidence?

But I know what Ed Neil's going to say: "The Zodiac never told us he was using
Wizard Pairs."

Uh . . . yes, he did, Ed.

In fact, he did it right there on the map (or what appears to be a map):



Ed, push that plate of beans away and look at this:

00 iiss ttoo bbee sseett ttoo MMaagg.. NN..

IIf that doesn't mean magnetic north, what DOES it mean?

Well, note that neither word in 'magnetic north' is usually capitalized, but
the Zodiac killer capitalizes BOTH the 'M' and the 'N'. If you're familiar with
word puzzles, capitalized letters should immediately suggest an acrostic:

""00 iiss ttoo bbee sseett ttoo MM NN..""

Or, to turn it into an equation:

""00 == MMNN..""

And what do we know about M and N? We know they're Wizard Pairs!

So the statement "0 = MN." actually means, ELIMINATE WIZARD PAIRS!

It's a KEY to what he's doing, similar to his signatures in Riverside that say

ZZ == rrhh

ZZ,, tthhee 2266tthh lleetttteerr == rr ((tthhee 1188tthh lleetttteerr)) ++ hh ((tthhee 88tthh lleetttteerr))

In other words, HE'S USING ALPHABET NUMBERS!

The Zodiac killer is ELIMINATING WIZARD PAIRS, and Shelly Holmboe was the
living manifestation of a Wizard Pair. But why bring her up now?

He brings her up now because she's the key to the map code.

Phillips 66

We've talked about the reference to magnetic north, and we've talked about the
clock face drawn on the map, but we haven't talked about the map's brand name.

One of the Zodiac killer's victims was named Phillips. I mentioned it in the
1990 editions of TZMS, and I think at least one poster mentioned it on the
original archived message board on zodiackiller.com, that Darlene Ferrin was
married to Jim Phillips three years before her murder. In other words, she was
Phillips in '66. That isn't the main point he's making by including the map,
but because symmetry is the principal design element of The Zodiac Project, he
gets at least two inferences out of every clue he sends.

The map title is yet another hint that he knew who his victims were before he
killed them.

How does the Zodiac killer know that Darlene Ferrin was once Darlene Phillips?
Someone with access to state records, such as an agent for the California
Highway Patrol (Hugh Penn), could easily have stumbled over that information
without trying too hard.

Phillips

But the Zodiac killer is more interested in PHILLIPS than he is in Darlene's
marital history.

Remember, he kills Shelly Holmboe to act out a deciphering technique (just as
he digs up a picket fence to do the same). His intent is to ELIMINATE WIZARD
PAIRS.

What Wizard Pair is he eliminating, in this case?

Here&#8217;s PHILLIPS:

PP HH II LL LL II PP SS

If you look at PHILLIPS for a moment or two, you will note that it contains a
Wizard Pair:

S-H, but in alphabetical order

Here&#8217;s PHILLIPS when the Wizard-Pair is removed:

PP II LL LL II PP

Note that this produces a palindrome:

PP II LL LL II PP

A palindrome is a word or phrase that reads the same, forward and backward.

Here are two examples:

Napoleon&#8217;s Lament: &#8220;Able was I, ere I saw Elba.&#8221;

And: &#8220;A man, a plan, a canal&#8212;Panama!&#8221;

Palindromes are dear to the Zodiac killer&#8217;s heart, because a statement
that reads the same forward and backward is symmetrical. A previous example in
the Zodiac literature is my idiosyncratic deciphering of VALLEJO:

VV AA LL LL EE JJ OO
2222 11 1122 1122 55 1100 1155

2222 11 ((112222)) 55 1100 1155

222211 112222 5511001155

VALLEJO, with the double-Ls read as 12-squared, and then as 122, consists of
two symmetrical numerical statements, 221122 and 51015, placed side-by-side.

The reader will note other structurally symmetrical statements in the Zodiac
killer lore, The 13-Character Cipher for example.



Let&#8217;s look at PILLIP.

PPIILLLLIIPP

PPII LLLL IIPP

Note that there are two instances of PI, just as there are two burial victims.

PI forward is ZODIAC (3.1415926 = C A D O I Z = ZODIAC).

PI backward is Michael O'Hare (Morse/binary pi = M.ERAHO).

As I'll suggest in the next chapter, each of the two women is murdered by ONE
of those mirror-image identities, thus, the two Ls flanked by forward- and
backward-pi.

PPII LLLL IIPP

PP II
1166 ++ 99 == 2255

Both victims were 25 at the time of their deaths.

There were three 8-balls flanking Shelly Holmboe&#8217;s initials in The 13-
Character Cipher.

Three times eight is 24. 'L' is the 12th letter of the alphabet, so 'LL' is
also 24.


PPII LLLL IIPP
2255 2244 2255

We know that 'LL', which for example is all over the Harden solution to The
Cryptogram, is a shorthand form of Michael O'Hare's birth date, January 22nd.

LLLL == ((1122))((1122))

Numbers written flush in mathematics are meant to be multiplied.

1122 xx 1122 == 112222 == 112222 == 11--2222

Again, that's not algebraically correct, but it is consistent with the Zodiac's
typical "fudging".

But 'LL' also means something else.

Berta Margoulies

In Berta Margoulies&#8217;s biographical entry in Contemporary American Women
Sculptors, Oryx Press, 1986, she includes an artist's statement and a picture
of a sculpture.



My scanner isn't state-of-the-art, so I'll translate the caption under the
photo:

Lost Lady Bronze 6 ft. Photograph by Michael O&#8217;Hare

1, Note that the title of the sculpture is inappropriate. The young woman
depicted would not usually be called a &#8216;lady&#8217; (perhaps a
&#8216;young lady&#8217;), since we normally think of &#8216;ladies&#8217; as
mature women. However, the woman in the sculpture could easily be in her mid-
twenties, and both Donna Lass and Joan Webster, the two Zodiac burial victims,
were 25 years old at the time of their deaths. That she's called 'Lost Lady'
suggests she hasn't been found as yet.

2, Note that the sculpture has been placed on open ground outside, rather than
indoors, as might be more usual for a sculpture. That the sculpture has been
placed on open ground might suggest that it belongs outside, even that it
stands as a kind of monument for someone under ground.

3, Note the feet of the sculpture. The inside edges of the feet are sharp and
apparently linear, as if they represent an angle, perhaps like the shadow cast
on the model of The MIT Tower, which is 117DEG (though there's no way to
measure the angle from the photograph).

4, Note that the figure holds the index finger of her left hand between thumb
and index of her right hand, and that her arms form a line that could easily be
57.29DEG off horizontal (again, there's no way of measuring this without access
to the sculpture itself).

5, Note that her head looks sharply to the left at what appears to be a 90DEG
angle.

Another picture of this particular sculpture is available at:

The Lost Lady presented in the sculpture is BOTH Donna Lass and Joan Webster,
and she is also the 'LL' in the center of PHILLIPS, once the Wizard Pair of HS
is removed.

The Zodiac killer is saying the same thing the hustler/magician in Restoration
says:

"Find the Lady!"

And I'm saying the same thing the Meg Ryan character says:

"Simple!"

Mt. Diablo Review

About half the material that pertains to The Mt. Diablo Letter I've put off
until the next chapter, either because it has to do with radians, or because
I'm reviewing all four ciphers there and I don't want to present material on
The 32 that has a more general context than just what's going on in those two
lines.

July 1970 Letters


The Zodiac killer&#8217;s July 26, 1970 letter included, at the very end, a
reference to radians that has tantalized and befuddled readers for over 40
years.

Many writers, including the always-loudmouthed-unless-he's-been-called-out Ed
Neil, have pontificated about what that reference might mean.

I'm about to TELL you what it means, in the most specific terms imaginable.

July 1970 Facts

The Zodiac killer sent two letters in July 1970, postmarked on July 24th . . .



. . . and July 26th.







The two July 1970 letters were withheld by the police and newspapers, just to
see what the Zodiac killer would do if he received no publicity. Although it
probably didn&#8217;t matter in any practical sense, this was theoretically a
mistake, since the information the Zodiac killer was sending the public was
intended to be sent and received sequentially.

There are a handful of aspects of these two letters I'll just comment on
quickly here, because I think the issues raised by the radian(s) PS. overshadow
everything else about them. However, as always, I reserve the right to bring
them up at a later time (possibly much later!).

A, The July 24th and 26th letters are the 3rd of 4th consecutive letters that
mention the Zodiac killer's desire to see people wearing buttons. As I've
mentioned, the fourth letter comes 89 days after the first, and the span in
days refers to an event in '89 (BUTON, which is The MIT Tower).

B, The mention of the Kathleen Johns kidnapping is probably remedial; he may
have felt it wasn't being sufficiently recognized as a Zodiac killer event.
Note that he says he burned her car where he found them, which is not actually
true; this is similar to his mentioning Washington & Maple in The School Bus
Threat Letter, when the Stine murder actually took place at Washington &
Cherry. He is drawing attention to his having moved a car (or having caused a
car to be moved, in the case of the taxi). He didn't burn the car where he
found them; he burned it at the intersection of Highway 132 and Bird Road (i.
e., FIRE-Bird, or Phoenix).

C, I've said that he almost certainly had a list of possible victims whose
names (and other aspects of their identities) fulfilled his requirements, thus
it became a matter of placement and timing (and perhaps even artistic judgment)
as to whom he killed and whom he passed on. But Kathleen Johns couldn't have
been the first on that list, even though he says her name starts off that list,
so he must mean that she is the first person who was selected as a public NON-
victim (because she's a NON-virgin). Note that he includes her baby as a
possible victim, which tells us that babies, such as Shelly Holmboe, were
always potential victims.

D, If "Lost Lady" is a possible reference from the central LL of PI LL IP,
"Little List" is another possible reference.

E, Since I'm going to mention Robert Salem a little later on, and we've been
talking about names on the Zodiac's Little List, it should be added that most,
and perhaps all, of the Zodiac killer's victims can be connected to the word
EASTER in some way. This is because the Zodiac killer uses Dante's IInnffeerrnnoo as a
literary model for his project, and the trip through Hell begins on Good Friday
and ends on Easter Sunday; thus, Easter is the finished product of the poem,
and victims associated with EASTER are the Zodiac killer's finished products
(i. e., victims).

I pointed out that SHELLY Holmboe contains EASTER in redivided Morse code (as
does DAVID Faraday and Darlene FERRIN). In the next chapter, I will demonstrate
that both Donna Lass and Joan Webster can be linked to EASTER, a word which
figures prominently in the disappearance of each woman.

Robert Salem may have been murdered on March 29, 1970, which was Easter Sunday
that year. In any case, his name contains EASTER as an anagram:

RRoobbEErrTT SSAAllEEmm

RREETTSSAAEE == EEAASSTTEERR (backward!!!)

Isn't that interesting? If you start at the beginning of ROBERT SALEM, and stop
at each first instance of a letter from EASTER (in other words, you'd pick the
first, but not the second 'R', and BOTH 'E's), you not only get all six
letters, you get EASTER spelled backward (RETSAE)!

Note that the Scrabble leftovers, O-B-R-L-M, can spell

MMOORRBBLL

. . . which is a phonetic spelling of the French morbleau, which means, "Scream
(blue) bloody murder!"

If there was ever a crime scene that screamed bloody murder, it was Robert
Salem's.


Zodiac Ciphers

I&#8217;m reviewing the ciphers here because the Zodiac killer, as of the
previous letter, has now sent the last one, and I&#8217;m going to demonstrate
what their actual purpose was (for example, where &#8216;radians&#8217; comes
in). For the reader to understand what The 32 meant, he has to understand why
the Zodiac killer was sending ciphers in the first place.

To begin with, the Zodiac killer didn&#8217;t really send four ciphers.

He sent ONE cipher, and sent that cipher in 4 (The Cryptogram + The 340 + The
13 + The 32), or 6 (The VTH + The SFE + The SFC segments of The Cryptogram +
The 340 + The 13 + The 32), installments.

Get it&#8212;46?

But why would he send a cipher anyway, if I&#8217;m saying the letters
themselves (and his actions, for that matter, such as dialing a rotary
telephone) contained enciphered information?

The cipher was intended to highlight the Zodiac killer&#8217;s "secret
operations", thus, he used secret writing. The "secret operations" included
four secret victims (Cheri Bates being a public victim, since he wrote letters
and a poem about her murder and did eventually &#8220;take credit&#8221; for
it) and The Terminus Event.

Let&#8217;s do a quick review of the individual installments of that single
cipher, with an eye toward their cumulative meaning, and in the light of the
realization that it's really all ONE cipher.


Cryptogram Parody

The Zodiac killer creates a multiple-substitution cipher complex enough to fool
the cryptanalysts at the NSA, CIA, FBI, American Cryptogram Association, Mensa,
and Naval codebreakers. This assumes, of course, that they HADN&#8217;T broken
the cipher and THEN changed some of the symbols, as Mike Rodelli has suggested
as a possibility. For the record, I think either scenario is plausible, but
Mike's theory makes more sense of what they did.

Having constructed a sophisticated cipher, the Zodiac killer uses it to send an
EXTREMELY unsophisticated message:

It&#8217;s almost as if he&#8217;s parodying the idea of conventional code-
breaking!

All the sentences of the supposed solution are inane and essentially without
meaning in terms of understanding The Zodiac Project, with the exception of

TTHHEE BBEESSTT PPAARRTT OOFF IITT IISS TTHHAAEE WWHHEENN II DDIIEE II WWIILLLL BBEE RREEBBOORRNN IINN PPAARRAADDIICCEE AANNDD AALLLL TTHHEE

. . . which means that when he dies, it will become clear that all his victims
were pre-selected because of their names and other superficial details having
to do with their identities. Thus, they were "slaves" in the sense of having no
lives of their own. They were &#8220;slaves&#8221; because they were doomed to
be parts of his puzzle.

But the Zodiac killer himself is a slave to his own pattern: since he had to
reveal himself somehow in every aspect of The Zodiac Project, he couldn&#8217;t
construct a completely meaningless message. He had to put SOME sense of what he
was really doing in there, in Sentence #5 . . . but, apart from some meaningful
details (KILLING PEOPLE is 74-69 by alphabet numbers, and he murdered Darlene
Ferrin on 7-4-69, give or take a few minutes), the rest is clearly just a joke
on his part.

But why would the Zodiac killer PARODY the idea of a straightforward cipher
solution?

Because, in real life, cipher solutions are NEVER straightforward. Ciphers have
historically been used in wartime to transmit information between forces on the
same side of a conflict.

I&#8217;ve mentioned the Battle of Midway as an example of a military action
that was decided, to a large extent, by cryptography. The United States
codebreakers were able to intercept transmissions in JN-25, which was one of
the Japanese naval codes, and thus learn of the pending attack on Midway.

By the way, I&#8217;ve been criticized in some circles (Hell itself being
constructed of circles) for using more than one method of code-breaking. Well,
oddly enough, the Japanese in WWII also used more than one code&#8212;there
were several Japanese naval codes, not to mention other specialized codes they
used like the Purple Code, which was for diplomatic instructions. I'm not going
to restrict myself to one mode of translation (alphabet numbers, or Morse code)
if the source appears to be speaking in several languages. The idea that an
opponent in war (and a serial killer is at war with society) would limit
himself to a single way of enciphering his messages is pretty nai"ve, isn't it?


In any case, expecting a straightforward solution is a little like expecting to
decipher a Jap transmission which reads:

Isn&#8217;t that cooperative of the Japs? They tell you exactly what
they&#8217;re doing, they tell you how they&#8217;re going to do it, and
it&#8217;s all written out in longhand! I&#8217;ll bet Ed Neil has tears of
gratitude rolling down his cheeks right now!

It&#8217;s stupid to expect a deciphered code to have a straightforward
solution, and BECAUSE it&#8217;s stupid, the sophisticated Zodiac killer makes
fun of it. In fact, it&#8217;s striking how similar the tone of my parody
Japanese transmission is to what the Zodiac killer actually sent. I think
that&#8217;s because the intent was the same, to poke fun at the expectations
of a code-challenged public. The Zodiac killer&#8217;s parody transmission (I
LIKE KILLING PEOPLE . . .) is essentially an announcement that his ciphers
won&#8217;t contain a straightforward solution.

So stop looking for one.

The police, newspapers, and general public read the &#8220;solution&#8221; to
The Cryptogram, their lips moving as they made their way over those six
sentences, and they shook their heads and said, &#8220;This guy&#8217;s not
very bright.&#8221; Which is ironic, if you think about it. It's like receiving
a gift inside a Chinese box and, when you finally figure out how to open it,
there's fecal matter inside!

The "gift" may seem crude, but the complexity of the box tells you the sender
isn't.

The Zodiac killer says, &#8220;In this cipher is my identity.&#8221; He
doesn&#8217;t say the cipher contains his name, necessarily, and a codebreaker
should not expect the Zodiac killer to make things easy for him. The puzzle
contained in The Zodiac Project isn&#8217;t simple; it&#8217;s not something
that can be arrived at by connecting a series of dots on paper.

The real information contained in The Cryptogram comes in the final 18 letters,
and consists of two statements about the ultimate end of The Zodiac Project:

&#8220;Death/929&#8221;, a BLAST from a BOMB located at BUTON, and planted in
Room 929 (the middle of an 18-story building) which destroys The MIT Tower by
breaking it in half.

&#8220;And I, Seeger (x2)&#8221;, a sniper event similar to The Texas Tower
massacre of August 1, 1966, but from the roof of a building in downtown Boston,
designated as "Seeger times 2". Since Alan Seeger (who also had a rendezvous
with death) was born on 73rd Street, "Seeger times 2" means 73 x 2, or 146. The
sniper&#8217;s nest thus will be designated as "146". This is also why he says,
in The Mt. Diablo Letter,

YYoouu hhaavvee uunnttiillll
nneexxtt FFaallll ttoo ddiigg iitt uupp..

Next Fall by acrostic is N-F.

N is the 14th letter, F is the 6th letter.

In other words, you have until "146", the event itself, to dig up the bodies.
You have that much time because, presumably, if you can find where the bodies
are buried, you&#8217;ve probably figured out The Zodiac Project (or enough of
it to stop The Terminus Event).

The Zodiac killer&#8217;s &#8220;code&#8221; in the cipher is actually a means
of decipherment, Morse code redivision. The only strategic purpose for those
first 390 letters of The Cryptogram is to give us the values for the subsequent
symbols by providing a context for them.

In other words, no context will be provided in the three later installments.

The other reason for The Cryptogram is to present pi (390/18, which is as close
as one can get, in 408 characters, to the breakdown between 3 and .1415926) as
a central motif.


340 Format

Speaking of pi, the Zodiac quotes The Mikado in The July 26, 1970 letter
because the Gilbert & Sullivan operetta premiered on March 14, 1885, March 14th
(3-14) being "pi-day". Incidentally, as Gareth Penn pointed out somewhere, the
Little List number is technically a "patter-song", which means you have a PS in
the letter preceding the radian PS (note also that a Zodiac victim has the
initials P-S, and 'PS' will show up prominently in the next chapter as a
destination).

As the Zodiac killer will say in both July 1970 letters, he&#8217;s got a
"little list" of potential victims, whose names and identities fit the
parameters of The Zodiac Project. The actual victims will be chosen by their
availability within a flexible time frame, and by whether he can locate them
where he wants to. Since all but one of those victim-names were never actually
used, and there are symbols which weren&#8217;t in The Cryptogram,
there&#8217;s no way to tell what those other names were. It&#8217;s certainly
possible that each line of The 340 contains a prospective victim-name.

But we know that the two Vallejo drivers, David Faraday (DAVID F) and Darlene
Ferrin (D FERRIN), are on Line 10, and Joan Webster (WEBSTER, JOAN) is on Line
18. I suspect that a victim named JOAN WEBSTER was the tenth target from the
very beginning, and that, even though Robert Salem and Donna Lass were still
future victims at the time of the mailing, the Zodiac killer only felt it
necessary to include one of those secret names in the list-cipher, perhaps to
make his "little list" as little as possible.

Incidentally, the article in The SF Examiner that presumably dooms Robert Salem
(&#8220;The Lamplighter of Stevenson Street&#8221;, Sunday, March 30, 1969)
obviously didn&#8217;t appear until long after The Zodiac Project was under
way, and Shelly Holmboe wasn&#8217;t even conceived yet when Cheri Bates was
murdered. So it&#8217;s clear that the Zodiac killer didn&#8217;t target
specific individuals from the very beginning; he targeted names and nominal
identities, and the actual victims were the result of logistical and perhaps
artistic choices he made along the way.

We know that the Zodiac killer connects the two Vallejo drivers

DDAAVVIIDD FF
DD FFEERRRRIINN

. . . in an overlapping linking form in The 340 undertext.

But what is the link between them and Joan Webster?Wouldn't it have made more
sense to link Donna Lass to Joan Webster, since those were the two buried
victims?

Well, he DOES link them in The 32. The link in The 340 is between David Faraday
(the first &#8220;public&#8221; victim killed by THE ZODIAC), who was killed on
December 20, 1968, and Joan Webster (the last &#8220;secret&#8221; victim), who
was killed on November 28, 1981.

December 20, 1968 can be written 12-20-68.

The 340, which contains Joan Webster's name, is sent on November 8, 1969.

Joan Webster is abducted and murdered on November 28, 1981.

That's 12 years and 20 days after the cipher is mailed.

1122--2200

But where's the 68?

68 is the difference between the first two ciphers.

440088
_--_33_44_00
6688

The reader will also note that the 97th character (Line 6, Character 12) has
been blacked out and replaced by a backward &#8216;K&#8217;.




The previous mailing to The Pen Card (November 8, 1969) was The School Bus
Threat Letter (October 13, 1969). The Zodiac killer had 26 days to construct
his new cipher (The 340), and yet, when it&#8217;s received, it&#8217;s found
to contain a mistake in the 97th character. What happened? None of the other
ciphers is marred by such a mistake, and the Zodiac killer had close to a month
to get this one ready for the mailing.

Gareth Penn says the Zodiac killer makes this apparent mistake to highlight
character #97 of The 340, and that&#8217;s part of the truth. However, he
doesn&#8217;t disturb the cipher grid lines anywhere else, thus, the mistake
seems a bit blatant for such a small return on it.

A more logical reason for the &#8220;mistake&#8221; is that the police changed
the cipher symbols in The Cryptogram in such a way that it defeated the Zodiac
killer&#8217;s purpose. Remember, I say the symbols retain their original
meaning in all four ciphers, such that the four ciphers are actually ONE
cipher. So if a particular symbol is misidentified, regardless of the reasons
for it, it may thwart his intent.

The Zodiac killer substitutes backward-K for what appears to be a blacked-out
square. I suspect the original symbol WAS a blacked-out square. There are no
blacked-out squares in The Cryptogram cipher text; the blacked-out squares that
seem to be there were actually created by the police when they changed the
cipher symbols.

Why wouldn&#8217;t the Zodiac killer just go ahead and use another symbol?

Because there are two solutions to each cipher. There&#8217;s the
&#8220;real&#8221; solution, whatever that is, and then there&#8217;s the
&#8220;proposed&#8221; solution of Gareth Penn, which is offered for publicity
reasons, to present a possible solution or method of decipherment. Gareth has
recently described his solution to The 340 as &#8220;serviceable&#8221; (he has
since deleted the statement from his Blogspot blog, GGZZ44221166); he doesn&#8217;t
tell us WHAT his reading may be servicing (such as, for example, misdirection
from the real solution).

That second solution has to be at least plausible. The reader will note that in
many cases, Gareth Penn analyzes a cipher based on the TYPE of symbol that is
presented (non-alphabetic, geometric, etc.). Thus, a symbol that is also a
geometric shape (a blacked-out square) might be more important than a letter,
and the police artist who made the changes concentrated on the geometric shapes
(with the exception of the &#8216;Z&#8217; leading off line 3 of The SF
Chronicle third of The Cryptogram&#8212;that was changed, clumsily, to a HALF-
blacked-out square). In any case, he can live with NO deciphering of a
particular symbol, but NOT with an incorrect deciphering. Note that this is
consistent with his other corrections, such as that the man in the PARKed car
(Paul Stine) was shot with a .38 (NOT a 9mm).

At the end of The 340, the Zodiac killer has sent all but 45 symbols of his
cipher.

The first 44 lines of the ONE cipher are all 17 characters long, and there are
24 (The Cryptogram) + 20 (The 340) lines in the cipher. Thus, the first two
installments are

4444 xx 1177 == 774488

. . . characters long.

But why 748?

In the special edition DVD of David Fincher&#8217;s ZZooddiiaacc, Russell Butterbach
of the Solano County Sheriff&#8217;s office, a patrolman in 1968 when the Lake
Herman Road murders took place, mentions hearing about those murders over the
police radio as he was leaving the Hell&#8217;s Angels pad on Warren Street. He
says that when he got back to the patrol car, he heard on the police radio that
there was a &#8220;double 187 on Lake Herman Road&#8221;.

What is a &#8220;187&#8221;?

All police agencies in California use a system of numbering crimes to make each
incident identifiable in the overall scheme of things.

By the way, isn&#8217;t that a bizarre concept? Using numbers to designate
crimes? One wonders if that&#8217;s where the Zodiac killer got the idea of
using numbers in the first place!

At any rate, the number 187 in the California Penal Code (another code!) refers
to the crime of, you guessed it, murder. A &#8220;double 187&#8221; was,
therefore, a double homicide.

By the time the Zodiac killer had sent both The Cryptogram and The 340,
he&#8217;d sent 748 cipher characters to the newspapers.

774488 == 118877 xx 44

Why?

Well, we know what &#8216;187&#8217; means, so what&#8217;s the &#8216;x
4&#8217;?

He multiplies 187 by four for the same reason the police radio says
&#8220;double 187&#8221;, to indicate how many murders he&#8217;s talking
about.

A cipher is a form of secret writing.

The Zodiac killer sends his first two ciphers in the form 44 x 17, or 187
(murder) times 4.

He&#8217;s saying, in SECRET writing, that there will be FOUR secret murders.

The four secret murders? In chronological order:

1. Shelly Holmboe 2. Robert Salem 3. Donna Lass 4. Joan Webster

Among other things, this tells us that whoever planned the Zodiac murders was
familiar with the California Penal Code. The designation &#8220;187&#8221; as a
synonym for murder is used nowadays by rap artists such as Snoop Dogg, but in
1966 the vast majority of Californians wouldn&#8217;t have been familiar with
it. Hugh Penn, who worked for the California Highway Patrol and the state
attorney general's office, knew the numbering system like the back of his hand.


Meanwhile, the Zodiac killer had been using lines consisting of 17 characters
exclusively.

Suddenly, in April 1970, he sends us a line of 13 characters. Why?


13 Wizard

The 13-Character Cipher contained, as its centerpiece, the initials of Shelly
Holmboe, when the same symbol-values are applied as were used in The Cryptogram
(S-H).

WW EE EE DD ((88--bbaallll)) SS ((88--bbaallll)) HH ((88--bbaallll)) ?? EE WW HH

The common thread of the last three ciphers is that they all contain victim-
names, or contain characters that stand for victims&#8212;

a, a name in redivided Morse code in The 340 (WEBSTER, JOAN);

b, a pair of initials, flanked by 8-balls, in The 13-Character Cipher (S-H),
and

c, a name containing the name of the symbol it stands for in The 32 Character
Cipher (JOAN WEBSTER = OMEGA).

The 8-balls flanking Shelly Holmboe's initials are intended to suggest that she
was always doomed, because EASTER was contained inside her name, and because
her initials were S-H (about which, more in a moment). But why use 8-balls
instead of some other symbol?

The number 8 is two to the 3rd power, or 23. It's a form of the number 23, and
we know that Shelly Holmboe was 23 months old when she was killed. But if The
Zodiac Project is based on the theme of 2 x 23, why use THREE versions of 23?

It's partly because the S-H in the center of the cipher takes the form of a
name on a headstone, and THREE times 23 is '69, which is the year of Shelly
Holmboe's death.

But there&#8217;s another, more convincing reason to use 8-balls.

There are 13 Wizard Pairs in the alphabet (13 sets of matching letters) . . .
of which HS (or SH), Shelly Holmboe&#8217;s initials, are the 8th pair!

88 BB AA LL LL
22 ++ 11 ++ 1122 ++ 1122 == 2277

27 is always the total of alphabet numbers for Wizard Pairs. A (1) + Z (26) =
27, B (2) + Y (25) = 27, and so forth.

Shelly Holmboe was &#8220;behind the 8-ball&#8221; because SH is the 8th set of
Wizard Pairs in the alphabet, and each pair adds up to 27 (B-A-L-L).

That&#8217;s also why the cipher itself contains 13 characters&#8212;there are
13 Wizard Pairs.


32 Format

As I said in the last chapter, The 32 isn&#8217;t a cipher in the sense of
containing a statement; it&#8217;s a map, in the sense of placing victims on
the landscape. In like manner, the Phillips 66 service station map wasn&#8217;t
really a map, at least in the context of The Zodiac Project; it was a
&#8220;code&#8221;, in the sense of presenting information that had been
encrypted(though the Phillips 66 map was a &#8220;found object&#8221;, not
something the Zodiac killer himself created).

The final three are 13, 17, and 15 characters respectively, and lines 45 and 46
(13 and 17 characters, respectively) each contain two symbols which stand for
murder victims.

The individuals depicted in lines 45 and 46 aren&#8217;t living people.
They&#8217;re symbols of the dead victims, buried in the case of Donna Lass and
Joan Webster, placed on or near The Mt. Diablo Meridian in the case of Shelly
Holmboe, and placed as a radian locator in the case of Robert Salem.So you have
this configuration in the ONE cipher:

LLiinneess 11--4444:: 774488 cchhaarraacctteerrss,, wwhhiicchh iiss 118877 ((mmuurrddeerr)) xx 44

lliinnee 4455 ((1133 cchhaarraacctteerrss)):: 22 mmuurrddeerreedd vviiccttiimmss

lliinnee 4477 ((1155 cchhaarraacctteerrss)):: ??

Thus, The 13-Character Cipher is Line 45 of the ONE cipher.

Salem Lass

I mentioned, in the previous chapter, that the Omega sign in The 32 stands for
Joan Webster, simply because JOAN WEBSTER contains OMEGA in redivided Morse
code.

There&#8217;s another symbol in The 32 that stands for the other burial victim-
-Donna Lass.



 On page 130 of Times 17, Gareth Penn points out that symbol #10 of The 13 and
symbol #8 of The 32 are both upside-down lower case &#8216;r&#8217;s, and only
appear in those two ciphers.



He calls this symbol &#8220;Radian&#8221;. That it appears in BOTH The 13 and
The 32 doesn&#8217;t make sense. If Omega stands for Joan Webster and appears
only once, &#8220;Radian&#8221;, which presumably stands for Donna Lass, should
only appear once as well, right?

Wrong. As I pointed out in Chapter M. Robert Salem, there is a SECOND radian
branching off the south leg of the Mt. Diablo radian, apexed at BM54, the Donna
Lass burial site, which connects BM54 to the Robert Salem murder site on
Stevenson.




In other words, there are TWO radians, and thus, the upside-down
&#8216;r&#8217; that Gareth Penn calls &#8220;Radian&#8221; can actually stand
for two DIFFERENT victims: Robert Salem and Donna Lass.

Since we know that Joan Webster stands for Omega in The 32, it&#8217;s probably
safe to assume that the &#8220;Radian&#8221; symbol in The 32 stands for Donna
Lass, the other buried victim.



By a process of elimination, this would lead us to believe that the
&#8220;Radian&#8221; symbol in The 13, character #10, stands for Robert Salem,
and since he was the next victim chronologically after Shelly Holmboe, who is
the centerpiece of The 13, that would also seem to make sense.



Let&#8217;s quickly review what we know about The 13 and The 32, the two of
which Gareth Penn calls &#8220;The Radian Ciphers&#8221;:

lliinnee 4455 ((TThhee 1133)):: 22 mmuurrddeerreedd vviiccttiimmss&&##88221122;;SShheellllyy HHoollmmbbooee aanndd RRoobbeerrtt SSaalleemm

lliinnee 4466 ((LLiinnee 11 ooff TThhee 3322)):: 22 bbuurriieedd vviiccttiimmss&&##88221122;;DDoonnnnaa LLaassss aanndd JJooaann WWeebbsstteerr

Note that the victims are placed, as symbols, in chronological order.

I said, in the previous chapter, that The 32 is actually a map, not really a
code.

This is also essentially true of The 13. The two ciphers are not statements in
any conventional sense. They perform the same function that a map
performs&#8212;they locate things on the landscape. In this case, they locate
Zodiac victims.

1. Shelly Holmboe is the centerpiece of The 13, because she essentially stands
for the apex of the larger radian, The Mt. Diablo Radian. That&#8217;s why her
body is placed on, or in proximity to, The Mt. Diablo Meridian. Her death
consecrates VABM 3849 in the same sense that a sacrificed animal consecrated
the Roman Terminus markers.

2. Robert Salem, the first &#8220;Radian&#8221; victim, is the 10th character
of The 13, comes immediately following the S-H/8-ball sequence, and is followed
by THREE characters.



3. Donna Lass, the second &#8220;Radian&#8221; victim, is the 8th character of
The 32, and is thus immediately preceded by SEVEN characters.



4. Joan Webster, represented by Omega, is the 13th character of The 32; she is
preceded by TWELVE, and followed by FOUR characters.

Remember, I said that the placement of Omega on a map of Greater Boston will
precisely locate the (original) burial position of Joan Webster.

That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ll talk about when we get to Boston.

For now, I&#8217;ll limit myself to discussing the two &#8220;Radian&#8221;
victims.


Maps

If superimposing The 32 on a map of Greater Boston will give us Joan
Webster&#8217;s (original) burial position, it&#8217;s reasonable to assume
that I intend to superimpose The 13 AND The 32 on maps of the SF Bay Area to
locate Robert Salem&#8217;s murder site and Donna Lass&#8217;s burial position.


Of course, we already know where Robert Salem died (the 700 block of Stevenson
Street) and I&#8217;ve already indicated Donna Lass&#8217;s burial position
(BM54 at 739 Clay Street in SF Chinatown). In that sense, we&#8217;re working
backward from what we know.

So the next question the reader probably has is&#8212;which map are we going to
use?

The Zodiac killer TELLS us which map to use, and he does it right there in the
letter. On the last page of The Mikado Letter, after he tells us he has a
Little List of victims, the Zodiac killer draws his largest crosshairs symbol,
taking up almost the entire page.

Why?

Remember, I said that the Phillips 66 service station map was inadequate to use
to draw a radian with, or anything else for that matter. First, because it
doesn&#8217;t contain Blue Rock Springs, but also because it&#8217;s not
magnetic, and there are no benchmarks (except for VABM 3849).



The crosshairs symbol is often seen spray-painted on sidewalks at construction
sites. The benchmarks on USGS maps are used to locate USGS benchmark discs,
which indicate specific elevations. The construction crew can then set their
altimeters and exactly locate where they are in space (usually in relation to
sea level).

These maps come in various sizes. The standard size is the quadrangle,
7.5&#8217; square, of use in construction because it locates these USGS
benchmarks within, say, a city grid.Benchmark 54 at 739 Clay Street, and the
Robert Salem murder site on Stevenson Street, in addition to the Paul Stine
murder site at Washington & Cherry, are all on a USGS quadrangle (7.5&#8217; by
7.5&#8217;, which would be a single square on a chessboard whose 64 squares
would be 1DEG) called &#8220;San Francisco North&#8221;, which contains most of
the top part of the city peninsula. Mt. Diablo, which is to say, VABM 3849, is
found on another quadrangle called &#8220;Clayton, California&#8221;.

 The crosshairs sign on page 2 of The Mikado Letter includes what people have
interpreted as a victim count, 13. I think the number in fact refers to The 13
Character Cipher, and means that that map ("San Francisco North") is to be used
in conjunction with The 13.



Since the crosshairs sign on page 5 is as big as he can make it (almost filling
a whole page), it&#8217;s reasonable to assume the Zodiac means this to
indicate the largest USGS map possible.





That would be USGS 1DEG x 2DEG maps.

Oddly enough, or perhaps not surprisingly, VABM 3849 is not on the same 1DEG x
2DEG map as the three sites in San Francisco. San Francisco is found on a 1DEG
x 2DEG map called, of all things, &#8220;San Francisco&#8221;. VABM 3849 is
found on a 1DEG x 2DEG map called &#8220;San Jose&#8221;. This is the largest
area available on a USGS map that still has topographic features (such as VABM
3849); these maps are not detailed enough to show benchmarks within the city
grid.

As the reader can see below, I have gone to the trouble of
&#8220;welding&#8221; the San Francisco and San Jose maps together along the
edge nearest VABM 3849 (which is near the corner of 122DEGW/38DEGN), so that
the resultant map includes both VABM 3849 AND the three sites in San Francisco.
It&#8217;s true that you can always go larger in scale, but when you do that,
you lose the necessary detail to calculate exactly where your reference points
are.



Here&#8217;s the interesting thing: when you &#8220;weld&#8221; the &#8220;San
Francisco&#8221; and &#8220;San Jose&#8221; maps together as I have, and then
draw a line from VABM3849 (Mt. Diablo) to BM54 (739 Clay Street) . . . that
line is 7 inches long. And I mean to say, it&#8217;s EXACTLY 7 inches long.

Now, granted, I&#8217;m not an artist like Mike Butterfield, and my
&#8220;weld&#8221; probably wouldn&#8217;t get past a municipal building
inspector in Pittsburgh. But it can&#8217;t be off by more than a couple of
hairs. Plus, since BM54 isn&#8217;t actually featured on the larger map, I had
to approximate its location. But I think I&#8217;m pretty close. And the line
connecting the two points is EXACTLY 7 inches long.

So 7 is the #inches along THAT radian.

Now let&#8217;s zoom in on &#8220;San Francisco North&#8221;. BM54 is a
featured point here, but I did have to approximate the location of Robert
Salem&#8217;s apartment/studio at 754 Stevenson.



Again, I can&#8217;t be off by more than a few hairs, and the line connecting
the two is 3 1/4 inches long. The reader will IMMEDIATELY note, if he&#8217;s
been paying attention all this time, that 3 1/4 is yet another way of saying
3.14, so there&#8217;s another pi in your face.

In any case, the line connecting the two points is 3 1/4 inches, so 3 is the
#inches along THAT radian.

73

7-3.

Where have we seen that sequence before?



Oh, that&#8217;s right. 7 is the number of characters preceding Donna
Lass&#8217;s position in The 32.



And 3 is the number of characters following Robert Salem&#8217;s position in
The 13.

73. 7-3 is the sequence, in inches, from VABM 3849 to BM54, and then from BM54
to 754 Stevenson Street.

And there are 73s everywhere you look.

73 is the street Alan Seeger was born on (73rd Street).

73 is the number of alphabet letters in The 13, once you eliminate the Wizard
Pair (S-H).

WW EE EE DD ((88--bbaallll)) SS ((88--bbaallll)) HH ((88--bbaallll)) ?? EE WW HH

WW EE EE DD EE WW HH
2233 ++ 55 ++ 55 ++ 44 ++ 55 ++ 2233 ++ 88 == 7733

73 is the number of alphabet letters on the top line of The 32, following the
radian symbol.

WW HH DD AA((OOmmeeggaa)) NN GG OO AA
2233 ++ 88 ++ 44 ++ 11 ++ 1144 ++ 77 ++ 1155 ++ 11 == 7733

The Mt. Diablo Letter, which contains the above symbol sequence, is mailed on
June 26, 1970. Donna Lass disappeared on September 6, 1970 . . . that's a span
of 73 days.

Shelly Holmboe is murdered on October 19th--73 days before the end of the year.

Perhaps most significantly, 73 is what you get when you un-shift

&& ##

on a typewriter keyboard--7-3.

In fact, the Zodiac killer even includes an &#8220;up&#8221; arrow to emphasize
the shift.

This isn't misdirection; this is an example of Hiding In Plain Sight.

Mt. Diablo Code

Let&#8217;s take a second look at his statement, in the light of these
revelations.

PPSS.. TThhee MMtt.. DDiiaabblloo ccooddee ccoonncceerrnnss

TThhee MMtt.. DDiiaabblloo ccooddee. . . which is actually BOTH The 13 and The 32.

It&#8217;s The 13 because Shelly Holmboe, who was murdered in proximity to The
Mt. Diablo Meridian, is the centerpiece of it.

It&#8217;s The 32 because Donna Lass&#8217;s burial spot (BM54 at 739 Clay
Street) is along the south leg of a radian apexed on Mt. Diablo.

. . . ccoonncceerrnnss rraaddiiaannss . . . radianS, PLURAL, which is what we have: a radian
apexed on Mt. Diablo, and a sub-radian formed by the south leg of that radian
and a line connecting BM54 to the Robert Salem murder site.

. . . &&##iinncchheess . . . which must mean, on a map.

It can&#8217;t mean inches in actual space, since the Mt. Diablo radian covers
something like 700 miles, which we would then have to multiply by 5,280 to get
the number of feet, and then by 12 to get the number of inches, and getting a
precise number might prove difficult.

. . . aalloonngg tthhee rraaddiiaannss . . . again, radianS, PLURAL, and again we&#8217;re
dealing with a double event:

a, inches along The Mt. Diablo Radian (7), and

b, inches along the BM54-754 Stevenson Sub-Radian (3).

I want to take Mike Butterfield as seriously as possible here because this is
the whole crux of his argument, or his opposition to MY argument.

Here&#8217;s the thing: if you take away the Zodiac killer&#8217;s mention of
&#8216;radians&#8217; (twice), Mike Butterfield has a much stronger case,
because Gareth Penn and myself are then assuming that radians WERE intended.
But once the Zodiac killer actually mentions &#8216;radians&#8217;, the need
for those radians to be absolutely accurately drawn on an undulating landscape,
and over 700 miles, becomes less critical, because we&#8217;re no longer
questioning how accurate he needs to be.

We&#8217;re now asking about his INTENT. I&#8217;ll give Mike and Ed Neil a
pass on their skepticism, now that I&#8217;ve demonstrated that there are, in
fact, radianS (PLURAL) with inches along them that can be measured (7 and 3).

I still think what Jake Wark said ten years ago, that dismissing the notion of
a single radian when the Zodiac killer mentions the term is counterintuitive. I
think, particularly now that I&#8217;ve added my own research to the argument,
that the Zodiac killer&#8217;s mention of the term within the context of
everything else becomes a little too much of a coincidence.

Diablo Implications

What do we know now that we didn&#8217;t know before?

a, The Zodiac killer is very smart. Arthur Leigh Allen would probably not be
able to pull all this off. Michael O'Hare, Berta Margoulies, Gareth and Hugh
Penn? Now you're talkin'!

b, How does Gareth Penn know, in 1987 when he wrote TTiimmeess 1177, that the inverted
lower-case 'r' symbol stands for 'Radian'? Ray Grant knows it because Gareth
told him, but how does Gareth know it? And is it reasonable to assume that, if
Gareth called The 13 and The 32 "The Radian Ciphers" and called the upside-down
'r' the Radian symbol, that he somehow knew what the significance of those
symbols were . . . but for some reason didn't tell us?

I can pretty much promise the reader that Gareth never expected to be in this
situation, where he'd have to explain the inexplicable things he was doing two
decades ago. He expected The Terminus Event to take place in 1989, and he'd
either be dead or . . . doing something else.

Gareth has now erased his blog on GZ4216. When I asked him if it was just a
coincidence that his phone number in 1987 was

((441155)) 449999--00667700

. . . he said it was Diane Merrill's phone number when he moved in with her in
1982.

Maybe it was, but the last five digits of that number are the date Donna Lass
disappeared.

c, Shelly Holmboe, Robert Salem, Donna Lass, and Joan Webster are very probably
Zodiac victims&#8212;either that, or he intended others to take their places
and I missed them, somehow.

I doubt it.
