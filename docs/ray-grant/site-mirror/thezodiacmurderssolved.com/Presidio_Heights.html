<br />
Brad Fischer (producer): I mean, this is, this is a guy with some serious confidence who <i>just barely escaped</i> on a fluke because the description was incorrect!<br />
<br />
James Vanderbilt (producer and screenwriter): Serious confidence but also, I mean, you know, <i>really just a lucky bastard</i>.&nbsp;
I mean, he should have been, this is not, you know, and this was
something we kind of came back to over and over again, as as you know
Brad, Dave, and I, I can't remember who coined it, but had this, uh,
this phrase, "Wily Coyote Super-Genius", and it's sort of this idea, and
we, we make fun of Robert, uh, Graysmith in the film for it because
there is this tendency and Graysmith has it and a lot of, you know,
other people who are interested in the case have it to kind of go, "This
guy was <i>Professor Moriarity</i>, he was <i>the greatest villain</i>--" <br />
<br />
Brad Fischer [laughing]: <i>He was the most brilliant serial killer ever!</i><br />
<br />
James Vanderbilt: --and he <i>wasn't</i>.&nbsp; He was a guy who got really
lucky, and and and so you know, constantly wanted to constantly kind of
deflate it.&nbsp; You know what I mean?<br />
<br />
I'm sorry, guys, I guess I DON'T know what you mean.&nbsp; Maybe if the three
of you had used a better metaphor than Wily Coyote, who was a notorious
failure, and instead used, I don't know, maybe "Road Runner
Super-Genius", since the Road Runner always got away . . . kind of, you
know, like the Zodiac killer?&nbsp; That you're the professional writer, and
I'm the amateur, should tell you all you need to know about Hollywood.&nbsp;
Needless to say, I don't agree with the Fischer-Vanderbilt version of
the Zodiac killer, which I will allude to here as "The Zodiac As Mr.
Magoo".<br />
<br />
Mr. Magoo was a nearsighted, nearly blind cartoon character who
otherwise lived a charmed life.&nbsp; If Magoo was about to walk off a bridge
into space, a crane would suddenly appear, hoisting an I-beam.&nbsp; Magoo
would somehow step smoothly onto the I-beam and cross it without missing
a step, and at the other end of the I-beam a truck would pass by, and
Magoo would walk across the top of the truck, which was passing under
another bridge, and Magoo would continue off the top of the truck onto
the walkway of the bridge, and so forth, all the while huffing and
puffing about what this crazy world was coming to these days.&nbsp; The humor
in the Mr. Magoo cartoon was in how he somehow managed to stroll
through the landscape without incident, while completely oblivious to
his unfailing good fortune and even cranky about his treatment.<br />
<br />
I'm not sure which real-life serial killer most resembles Mr.
Magoo--maybe Ed Gein, the basis in fact for the fictional Norman Bates
and Dr. Hannibal Lecter.&nbsp; Unlike his Hollywood counterparts, who were
neurotics (at least, most of the time), Ed Gein was psychotic, and able
to avoid capture only as long as he remained inside his own little
world.&nbsp; Once he ventured outside it, the police were quickly able to
figure out, from his bizarre affect, how he kept himself busy.<br />
<br />
I don't think Mr. Magoo would survive long as a serial killer.&nbsp; Those
who think he resembles the Zodiac killer say he's remained unknown
because he was institutionalized, either in prison or in a mental
hospital.&nbsp; I don't think either of those scenarios is likely.&nbsp; People
who lose their freedom also lose control of their privacy, and a
psychotic who was the Zodiac killer would have been found out, either
because his belongings included items the Zodiac killer was likely to
have (such as crime scene souvenirs and Zodiac weapons) or because his
bizarre behavior would have created suspicion.<br />
<br />
I think the Zodiac killer escaped capture precisely because he WASN'T
just a lucky bastard.&nbsp; I believe he planned everything he did well in
advance and did local research about what was likely to happen, and when
you do that, you greatly increase your odds of avoiding capture.<br />

</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Paul Stine was already on his way to a fare on 9th Avenue when the
Zodiac killer flagged him down in the theatre district on Saturday
night, October 11, 1969. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
Stine wrote &#8216;Washington &amp; Maple&#8217; in Presidio Heights in his trip
book, but when they arrived at that corner, the Zodiac killer apparently
instructed him to go another block, to Washington &amp; Cherry.&nbsp; After
Stine pulled over and put the car in PARK, the Zodiac killer grabbed him
from behind and fired a bullet through his skull.<br />
<br />
The Zodiac killer then exited the cab and got into the front seat
through the passenger side door.&nbsp; He got back out a minute or so later
and wiped down the outside of the cab, in the process leaving two bloody
fingerprints of his own on the driver&#8217;s side door separator.&nbsp; He then
began walking down Cherry Street.<br />
<br />
Two SFPD radio car cops apparently saw the Zodiac killer as he reached
Jackson &amp; Maple, but the APB had mistakenly specified a Black Male
Adult, so they let him continue on his way.<br />
<br />

</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
There&#8217;s a term teenage boys use to describe a virginal girl.&nbsp; They say
she&#8217;s &#8216;cherry&#8217;.&nbsp; There&#8217;s also a song by Jan and Dean, &#8220;Surf City&#8221;, which
describes a &#8217;30 Ford wagon:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;You know it&#8217;s not very cherry<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It&#8217;s an oldie-but-a-goodie</b><br />
<br />
Pagan ritual specifies that the sacrificed human victim be a virgin.&nbsp;
And the Zodiac killer goes to the trouble, at Lake Berryessa, of
dressing up in costume not unlike a medieval executioner.&nbsp; Throughout
the Zodiac Project, the victims are dealt with in a ritualistic manner,
either in the way they are selected, or killed, or both.&nbsp; For example,
all three Sunday victims (Cheri Bates, Shelly Holmboe, and Robert Salem)
are stabbed to death and nearly decapitated, which is the traditional
method of killing a pagan sacrifice victim. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The Zodiac killer had Paul Stine drive an extra block from Washington
and Maple so that the cabbie could then become a suitable &#8220;virginal&#8221;
victim at Washington and CHERRY.&nbsp; He CAN&#8217;T kill Stine at Washington
&amp; Maple because it&#8217;s not an appropriate place, and he asks for
Washington &amp; Maple when he gets in the cab so he can demonstrate
this to the world.&nbsp; The world wasn&#8217;t paying attention, but that&#8217;s not
his fault!<br />
<br />
When he kidnaps Kathleen Johns in March 1970, the entire episode is a
demonstration of what he CAN&#8217;T do, which is why Johns survives.&nbsp; More on
that when the time comes.</font><font face="Garamond, Times, Serif" style="font-size: 18px;"><br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Garamond, Times, Serif" style="font-size: 18px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Virgin Victims 2</font></font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif" style="font-size: 18px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Let&#8217;s take a second look at some of these &#8220;virgin&#8221; victims:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 1, We don&#8217;t know if Miss Bates was a virgin, but she definitely was CHERI.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 2, The two teenagers at Lake Herman Road were likely virgins.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3, Darlene Ferrin, who was already married to her second husband and out in a car with a man who <i>wasn&#8217;t</i>
her husband, can safely be ruled out as a virgin.&nbsp; However, she had
recently returned from a vacation trip to the Virgin Islands, and she
lived on Virginia Avenue.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4, Cecelia Ann Shepard was a devout churchgoing young woman, and in spite of the cozy scene in David Fincher&#8217;s movie <b>Zodiac</b>,
had no intimate relationship with Bryan Hartnell, the man she was with
at the time of her murder.&nbsp; She was just 20 years old and very likely a
virgin.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 5, The one-year-old toddler, Shelly Holmboe, was certainly a virgin.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 6, Robert Salem&#8217;s last name evokes ritual and witchcraft and the
burning at the stake of young girls who were, in most cases, literally
innocent.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 7, Donna Lass, kidnapped from the Sahara Hotel, had a last name
which means a young, virginal girl in the Scottish or Cornish highlands,
the typical pagan sacrifice victim.</font><font face="Garamond, Times, Serif" style="font-size: 18px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
<br />
</font></font></font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Garamond, Times, Serif" style="font-size: 18px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Front Seat 1</font></font></font></font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif" style="font-size: 18px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">When the Zodiac killer got into the front seat of Paul Stine&#8217;s cab, he
did at least four things, which I will enumerate a section at a time.&nbsp;
Am I engaging in pure speculation again, as I did in assuming that Cheri
Bates was actually kidnapped and never went into the RCC library?&nbsp;
Perhaps.&nbsp; But let&#8217;s walk through the Zodiac killer&#8217;s post-mortem (as far
as the victim was concerned) actions at the cab, and see if I can make
sense of what he did:<br />
<br />
I have no way of knowing for sure what the Zodiac killer did in the
front seat of Paul Stine&#8217;s cab.&nbsp; Witnesses saw him get into the
passenger side of the front seat, but what he did once he was inside,
only one person knows for sure.&nbsp; But we know he pulled the tail of
Stine&#8217;s shirt out of his pants and hacked off a piece with a knife,
because he subsequently sent rectangles of the garment to authenticate
his letters.<br />
<br />
If you recall my saying that the Zodiac killer was spelling his name,
here&#8217;s a major clue in that direction.&nbsp; Why does he have to risk being
caught at the cab by taking time to hack off Stine&#8217;s shirt?&nbsp; There&#8217;s a
much easier and less dangerous way of linking all his crimes, and yet,
for some reason, he chooses not to take that path of least resistance.&nbsp;
Why?</font><font face="Garamond, Times, Serif" style="font-size: 18px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
<br />
</font></font></font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Garamond, Times, Serif" style="font-size: 18px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Front Seat 2</font></font></font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif" style="font-size: 18px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">We know, of course, that the Zodiac killer also took Paul Stine&#8217;s
wallet.&nbsp; We can probably assume he did it to be able to prove his guilt
later on.&nbsp; But the Zodiac killer&#8217;s taking possession of the wallet
disproves an assumption made by Robert Graysmith.&nbsp; Graysmith has said
that the Zodiac killer used a different gun each time because he ditched
the gun shortly after each murder, so he wouldn&#8217;t be found with the
murder weapon on him.&nbsp; To which I say, What good would it do you to
ditch the gun, if you&#8217;ve kept a souvenir from the crime scene&#8212;in
particular, the victim&#8217;s blood-soaked wallet?<br />
<br />
Another obvious problem with the gun-ditching scenario is that it allows
the gun to possibly be traced back to its owner, if found.<br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Front Seat 3</font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">We also know he pulled Paul Stine&#8217;s dead body over onto the passenger
seat before he exited the cab.&nbsp; He must have, because even if Stine had
slumped onto the passenger seat after he was shot, the Zodiac killer
would have had to push him back over toward the driver&#8217;s side in order
to get into the front seat himself.&nbsp; If you look at photos of the crime
scene, you will notice that Stine&#8217;s torso has been pulled to the
passenger side, in such a way that his arm hangs out the door.&nbsp; It's
possible that the morgue stewards moved the body, but patrolman Armand
Pelissetti, first on the scene, describes Stine's torso as being on the
passenger side with his head touching the floor.&nbsp; If you read the
section on the Vallejo passengers, you know why this was done.<br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Front Seat 4</font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
I believe the Zodiac killer did one other thing while he was in the
front seat of Paul Stine&#8217;s cab, and though I can&#8217;t offer proof of what
I&#8217;m suggesting, it fits both the physical evidence and the Zodiac
killer&#8217;s methodology.&nbsp; He removed Paul Stine&#8217;s own metal-banded wrist
watch and replaced it with a black-banded Timex, exactly like the one
left at the Riverside murder scene, which had been stopped at 12:22.&nbsp;
The Presidio Heights Timex, if it is ever recovered among Paul Stine&#8217;s
effects, will be found to have been stopped at 1:46.<br />
<b><i><br />
</i>Toschi had noticed two long dark marks on Stine's left hand.&nbsp;
Perhaps he had thrown up his hand to protect himself from the gun
blast.&nbsp; </b>Robert Graysmith, <b>Zodiac</b>, page 91 of the hardcover edition<br />
<br />
The act of pulling the metal band off Stine&#8217;s wrist caused long dark
scrapes on the skin of his forearm, which were noticed by SFPD Inspector
Dave Toschi.&nbsp; The blood of a dead person is no longer pumping through
his body, thus any rough treatment of the skin post-mortem will leave a
mark.&nbsp; This Timex--the one planted by the Zodiac killer--is clearly
visible in photos of the scene showing Stine&#8217;s hand hanging out the cab.<br />
<br />
Incidentally, David Faraday was also wearing a black-banded Timex at the
time of his death, so it&#8217;s possible that one was also planted by the
Zodiac killer.&nbsp; I&#8217;m choosing Paul Stine as the more likely
plant-recipient because there were dark scratches on his forearm/wrist
area, but either or both could have received new timepieces from the
Zodiac killer.<br />
<br />
By the way, it&#8217;s probably of some significance that we know Timexes
&#8220;take a licking but keep on ticking&#8221;, but in the case of the Zodiac
killer&#8217;s planting of stopped Timexes, he was strapping them onto victims
who themselves were no longer ticking.&nbsp; I suspect he left a watch by
Cheri Bates&#8217;s body, instead of putting it on her wrist, because it was
more likely to be taken note of if police assumed it belonged to her
assailant.&nbsp; Whereas leaving a watch beside David Faraday or Paul Stine
would have begged the question of how the killer happened to lose it.<br />
<br />
It also would have been a less subtle clue.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Misidentification</font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">SFPD misidentified the slug from the gun, most likely because it
sustained significant damage colliding with Paul Stine&#8217;s skull.&nbsp; It was
NOT from a .9mm.<br />
<br />
[Rust] <b>found a copper-jacketed slug, badly misshapen but recognizable as a 9-mm. or .38 caliber.</b>&nbsp; Robert Graysmith, <b>Zodiac</b>, page 32 of the hardcover edition<i><br />
</i>
<br />
Clearly, a 9mm or .38 slug could easily be mistaken for each other, even
by forensic personnel.&nbsp; Someone recently pointed out to me that the
original San Francisco Chronicle story misidentified the 9-mm slug as a
.38.&nbsp; I believe the misidentification was in the other direction, but in
any case, the SFC reporter wouldn't have made up the gun typing while
he was writing the story; if he reported a gun type, it's because that's
what his source, SFPD, gave him.<br />
<br />
In the Zodiac killer&#8217;s &#8220;Mt. Diablo Letter&#8221; of June 26, 1970, he states<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>I shot a man sitting in<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;a parked car with a .38.</b><br />
<br />
The Zodiac killer was NOT, as SFPD has stated, taking credit for a
murder he did not commit (Officer Richard Radetich had been shot in a
parked police car just prior to the &#8220;Mt. Diablo Letter&#8221; mailing).&nbsp;
Instead, the Zodiac killer was correcting the gun typing for the
Presidio Heights murder, from 9mm. to .38.&nbsp; The &#8220;man sitting in a parked
car&#8221; was actually Paul Stine, who had put his cab in PARK just prior to
being shot in the back of the head.&nbsp; The Zodiac killer was saying, &#8220;I
didn&#8217;t use a 9mm.&nbsp; I used a .38.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Reporter Paul Avery would supposedly tell Gareth Penn, at a conference
in the early 1980s, that the original gun identification had been a
mistake.&nbsp; Presumably, SFPD never corrected the gun ID publicly for the
same reason they changed the 20 symbols in The Cryptogram, so they would
have yet another &#8220;key&#8221; they could use to catch the real killer.<br />
<br />
This corrected information tells us at least two things:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1, the gun numbers themselves mean something; and<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2, the other gun numbers&#8212;22 (Lake Herman), 9mm (Blue Rock Springs),
and .45 (Lake Berryessa) are all correct, because the Zodiac didn&#8217;t
publicly correct them as he did with the Presidio Heights gun number.<br />
<br />
So we now have a corrected chronological sequence of gun numbers&#8212;22, 9,
45, and 38&#8212;that would seem to be important to the killer.&nbsp; What could
they possibly spell out?<br />

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Does it strike anyone out there that the Zodiac killer was going to
absolutely absurd lengths to connect his murders?&nbsp; If you just killed
someone on a street corner in an upscale part of town&#8212;where the cops are
going to respond quickly to any emergency call--would you take the time
to get into the bloody front seat of his car and hack off a piece of
his shirt while the cops were redlining to the murder scene, just so you
could later take credit for it?<br />
<br />
What&#8217;s wrong with this picture?<br />
<br />
In 1973-1974, a group of Black Muslims began randomly shooting white
victims in San Francisco in what came to be called the Zebra murders.&nbsp;
Even though different gunmen were involved in each crime, the murders
were connected because they were all committed using the same gun.&nbsp;
Police can do a ballistics match in a matter of hours.&nbsp;&nbsp; So why wouldn&#8217;t
the Zodiac killer just use the same gun each time, and save himself all
that extra work?&nbsp; What&#8217;s the down side of using the same gun each time?<br />
<br />
Well, as I said earlier, you can&#8217;t be ditching the gun for the reason
Robert Graysmith suggested, to avoid being caught with it on you, when
you&#8217;ve just taken the victim&#8217;s bloody wallet with you (not to mention
wearing his blood on your clothes).<br />
<br />
Remember, the Zodiac killer sent messages every time he did something.&nbsp;
And you can&#8217;t send a message, even where numbers take the place of
letters in a substitution sequence, by merely repeating the same number.<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<b><u>The Crime&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Weapon</u><br />

&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
Yes, I&#8217;m aware that the victims at Lake Berryessa weren&#8217;t shot.&nbsp; They
weren&#8217;t shot because he had to stab them 17 times to identify himself by
knife.&nbsp; But the Zodiac killer still showed them a gun which Bryan
Hartnell identified in public accounts of the encounter as a .45.&nbsp; So
the Zodiac was satisfied that that number&#8212;45&#8212;had gotten out.<br />
<br />
Now we have a numerical sequence from someone who loves to turn letters
into numbers and numbers into letters.&nbsp; Plus, we have to assume the gun
sequence is of prime importance, right?<br />
<br />
So what could it possibly spell?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>22&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;45&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;38</b><br />
<br />
Let&#8217;s begin where we always do, by using basic alphabet substitution.&nbsp;
Since we have numbers above 26, we&#8217;ll use a repeating sequence, where
A=27, B=28, and so forth.&nbsp; This gives us<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>22&nbsp;&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp; 45&nbsp; 38<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;V&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;L</b><br />
<br />
Could Elvis be the Zodiac killer?&nbsp; I thought the Zodiac killer was High
Class, but maybe that was just a lie?&nbsp; Anyway, there&#8217;s no Mister E,
right?&nbsp; Let&#8217;s try something else!<br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Gun Numbers 3</font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>22&nbsp;&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp; 45&nbsp; 38<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;V&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;S&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;L</b><br />
<br />
Okay, Elvis probably wasn&#8217;t the Zodiac killer.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t always get things on your first crack.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>22&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;45&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;38</b><br />
<br />
Alphabet substitution is the most basic form of number-to-letter code.&nbsp;
The second most basic is reverse alphabet numbers.&nbsp; In other words, Z=1,
Y=2, X=3, and so forth.&nbsp; Converting the four gun numbers using this
repeating sequence gives us<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>22&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;45&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;38<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;E&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; R&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; H&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; O<br />
</b><br />
I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s difficult to see ERHO as a form of OHARE backwards.&nbsp;
And spelling his name backwards would make sense, since the binary form
of pi spells M.ERAHO.&nbsp; But then why remove the central A?<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s done to repeat the overall pattern, again using alphabet numbers.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>E&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;R&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;O<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5&nbsp; +18 = 23&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8 + 15 = 23</b><br />
<br />
The Zodiac killer&#8217;s gun numbers, in sequence, spell his name backwards.&nbsp;
They actually spell a form of his last name which converts to 23/23.&nbsp;
And again, I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s a coincidence.<br />

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Right around this point in David Fincher&#8217;s movie, <b>Zodiac</b>, about
40 minutes into the movie, both newspaper men (Paul Avery and Robert
Graysmith) and both police investigators (Dave Toschi and Bill
Armstrong) begin discussing patterns in the Zodiac murders.&nbsp; There are
no fingerprints at Lake Herman Road, Blue Rock Springs, or Lake
Berryessa or in any of the letters&#8212;then the Zodiac killer leaves prints
in blood on the cab at Presidio Heights, taking his gloves off to do
so.&nbsp; At Lake Herman Road, he kills both victims, but then only kills the
female at Blue Rock Springs and Lake Berryessa while wounding the
males.&nbsp; He attacks couples in lovers lanes&#8212;but Paul Stine breaks that
pattern.<br />
<br />
Think about it, reader.<br />
<br />
If you kept doing the same thing over and over, police and reporters
would not take time to analyze your pattern, because you wouldn&#8217;t be
varying it.&nbsp; You call attention to your modus operandi by varying it.&nbsp;
The Zodiac killer does things differently each time to call attention to
his m. o..&nbsp; And we know that everything he calls attention to
identifies him somehow.&nbsp; Well, what could be self-identifying about an
m. o.?<br />
<br />
And what are Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s initials, anyway?<br />
<br />

Sort of like what the Zodiac killer was doing at Lake Berryessa.<br />

sequence, you can send more than one message.<br />

If the Presidio Heights homicide is the end of the public murders, the
Zodiac killer does the final one in a car that's wearing a costume.&nbsp; San
Francisco cabs were, I believe, Chevrolet Chevelles.&nbsp; But I suspect the
cab is intended to stand for Michael O'Hare's costumed self.&nbsp; Thus,
what precedes the cab is his real self.<br />
<br />
If he can send a message with guns, he can send one with cars.&nbsp; After
all, he was picking victims from the state vehicular data base.&nbsp; Let's
look at which vehicles his victims were driving:<br />
<br />
<b>Cheri Bates&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; David Faraday&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Darlene Ferrin&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bryan Hartnell&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Paul Stine<br />

22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 3&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --</b><br />
<br />
Note, again, that the two DFs represent mirror-image crimes, so we'll add those together.<br />
<br />
<b>22&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 18 + 3 = 21 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 22</b><br />
<br />
Note that this is a palindrome that spells out Michael O'Hare's birthdate, forward and backward.<br />
<br />
<b>22 + 21 + 22<br />
</b>
<br />
<b>22 / 43<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 43 / 22</b>
<br />
<br />
Both represent January 22, 1943, the 22nd day of '43 (22-43).<br />
<br />
The gun numbers sequence spells out his name.&nbsp; The car sequence spells out his DOB.<br />

<br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">Just how lucky was the Zodiac killer?&nbsp; Even if you limit yourself to the four public SF Bay Area murder-events, he seemed to be <i>extremely</i>
lucky.&nbsp; As investigators pointed out, there was about a six minute
window for him to have committed the murders on Lake Herman Road and not
be seen by anyone driving by.&nbsp; He manages to avoid police at Blue Rock
Springs, even though a patrol car had been out in that parking lot a
half-hour before.&nbsp; And, in San Francisco, he stays at the car for a
minute or two after shooting the driver, and then strolls through the
neighborhood with police cars redlining past him . . . and the only
thing that seems to save him from capture is the misidentification of
the suspect as a Black Male Adult.<br />
<br />
If you're like me, and you don't buy into The Zodiac As Mr. Magoo scenario, it's all very spooky.<br />
<br />
Of course . . . if a killer <i>is</i> bright enough to appear to move
the victims around, and move their cars around, and time everything with
great serendipity . . . would it be a stretch to assume that he's also
moving the cops around, too?<br />
<br />
Don't get me wrong.&nbsp; As we learned from watching The Alfred Hitchcock
Hour back in the 1950s, the best-laid plans of killers often fall prey
to happenstance, the sudden unexpected appearance of the mailman (I
thought I'd sneak that image in here somewhere), and just bad luck, and
no amount of planning is going to do away with the element of surprise.&nbsp;
The Zodiac conspirators must have resigned themselves to the
possibility that the entire project was subject to the law of chance.&nbsp;
But . . . <br />
<br />
There's a lot you can do to avoid bad luck, if you spend enough time
thinking things through in advance.&nbsp; As James Siegel says near the end
of his excellent novel, <b>Derailed</b>, Fate laughs at people with a Plan, but smiles on those who bring a Back-Up Plan.<br />
<br />
The six minutes at Lake Herman Road, and the avoidance of patrol cars at
Blue Rock Springs?&nbsp; With the logistical expertise of Hugh Penn, and a
police radio, you can strike when the cops are busy elsewhere (as they
were in both cases).&nbsp; And you can minimize your own vulnerability.<br />
<br />
As a Chicago homicide detective recently pointed out on ZKF (before
being banned from the site), the Zodiac killer APPEARED to time his
attacks so they'd take place during police shift changes, or on weekends
when more experienced personnel were off.<br />
</font></font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
At
Lake Herman Road, the Zodiac killer is there long enough to kill the two
teenagers, and then he's gone.&nbsp; At Blue Rock Springs, though he comes
back to the car (for reasons I've already given--to spread W-Ws all
over) a second time, he is otherwise economical in his movements and
probably spends no longer than a minute or so in that clearing.&nbsp; He has more
to do at Lake Berryessa, and the area is remote, but he still moves
quickly and gets himself out of there after just a few minutes.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
In Presidio Heights, he <i>appears</i> to have taken some crazy chances.&nbsp; But did he?<br />
<br />
Let's consider what I think are the two most likely scenarios:<br />
<br />
<br />
</font></font></font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Presidio Scenario 1</font></font></font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">The Zodiac killer was last seen walking down Cherry Street that Saturday
night.&nbsp; We know he turned the corner and disappeared into the
darkness.&nbsp; I submit that anything said about his activity beyond that
point is pure speculation.&nbsp; Since I believe the Zodiac killer was
Michael O'Hare, and since I say he always intended to kill Paul Stine at
the corner of Washington and Cherry Streets, there would have been
absolutely no reason for him to stroll through the neighborhood.<br />
<br />
Since we now know that he didn't change his mind about where the murder
would be, he wouldn't have any need to double back toward Maple Street.&nbsp;
He'd have parked his car on Cherry Street and made his way to Geary
Street by bus (Robert Graysmith speculates as much on page 82 of the
hardcover <b>Zodiac</b>, except for not thinking the car was parked
specifically on Cherry Street).&nbsp; His car, I believe, would have been
parked just far enough down the street to avoid having it seen by
someone witnessing the crime.&nbsp; He'd have walked down the street, gotten
into the car, and been miles away by the time Armond Pelissetti pulled
up at the corner.<br />
<br />
How do I explain Donald Fouke's testimony, given that scenario?&nbsp; There's
no need to.&nbsp; As Pelissetti said, Fouke probably did NOT see the Zodiac
killer, even if he believes he did.&nbsp; Fouke says he passed a man on
Jackson Street walking in an easterly direction on the north side of the
street.&nbsp; Fouke's squad car was going about 40mph, and slowed to 25mph
long enough to ascertain that the man was white, not black, and then
sped on.&nbsp; The entire incident lasted 15 seconds, tops.&nbsp; Fouke's primary
concern, while looking at the man, was his color, and yet he gives a
full description of the man's outfit, which did not include any blood
(which the Zodiac killer would have been covered with).&nbsp; Fouke is the
only Zodiac eyewitness who describes him as a man 35-45; everyone else
(Michael Mageau, the teenagers on Washington, and Kathleen Johns)
describe a man in his 20s.&nbsp; Fouke says he submitted his version of
events a month later.&nbsp; But it would have been known to everyone in the
SFPD that the Zodiac killer had committed the crime the following
Tuesday.&nbsp; Why would he wait an entire month?<br />
<br />
How do I explain the Zodiac killer's saying he was stopped and talked to
by the police?&nbsp; Fouke eventually told Pelissetti that he thought he
stopped the Zodiac killer, in which case that story would have spread
through the law enforcement community like wildfire.&nbsp; The Zodiac killer
would have been aware of it because Hugh Penn would have heard about it,
and he could have made up the part about being stopped by police
because that's what the rumor buzzing about the Bay Area police agencies
was.<br />
<br />
Wasn't the Zodiac killer lucky that the dispatcher said Black Male
Adult?&nbsp; Maybe, but it might be interesting to see the statistics on cab
hold-ups in San Francisco back then, just to see what percentage were
committed by black men.&nbsp; I tend to believe that the very phrase CAB
HOLD-UP would have suggested a black suspect to SFPD personnel.&nbsp; In any
case, if Michael O'Hare had parked on Cherry Street and driven away
immediately after leaving the cab, it never mattered what the APB
description of him was, right or wrong.<br />
<br />
Scenario #1 makes a lot of sense to me; it's logical, and it explains everything.<br />
<br />
But I have to reject it because . . . <i>because I don't think it's what the Zodiac killer would do.<br />
</i><br />
I think what really happened is Scenario #2.<br />
<br />
<br />

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Michael
O'Hare leaves the cab between 9:50pm and 9:55pm and begins walking down
Cherry Street.&nbsp; Behind him, a few minutes later, Armond Pelissetti
arrives at Washington &amp; Cherry (supposedly at 9:55pm, but the call
from the teenagers on Washington is logged at 9:58pm, so 10pm or later
is probably more like it).&nbsp; Meanwhile, Donald Fouke has heard the
initial APB about a cab robbery/shooting by a Black Male Adult and
begins driving at 35-40mph down Jackson Street toward Cherry.&nbsp; As he
drives through the intersection at Maple he sees Michael O'Hare on the
far side of the intersection, on the north side of the street, walking
in the direction of Maple.&nbsp; Fouke slows the cab down long enough to
ascertain that Michael O'Hare is white, not black, and hits the
accelerator again, leaving O'Hare to dwindle in his rear-view mirror,
though he does notice that O'Hare avoids looking at the police car and
begins walking up a flight of steps just as the police speed away.<br />
<br />
When Fouke turns the corner at Jackson &amp; Cherry, he runs into Armond
Pelissetti pursuing the suspect on foot.&nbsp; Pelissetti corrects the APB
description, saying the suspect is a White Male Adult.&nbsp; Fouke says that
he then swore and told Pelissetti that he had seen the killer on Jackson
Street; Pelissetti says Fouke said nothing about having seen a suspect
that evening, but subsequently did admit to seeing a man who may have
been the Zodiac killer.<br />
<br />
Almost a month later, the Zodiac killer writes a letter in which he
describes the police stopping him on the street about three minutes
after the shooting and asking him if he had seen anything suspicious.&nbsp;
The Zodiac killer replies that he saw a man waving a gun and the police
speed off in the direction he indicates.&nbsp; A day or so following receipt
of this letter, Fouke finally submits an account of his sighting a
suspect on Jackson Street (but not speaking to him).<br />
<br />
What happened?&nbsp; Everyone who has reported on the police reaction that
night has taken pains to remind his readers that the police didn't know
Paul Stine's assailant was the Zodiac killer until the following week,
when the letter containing a piece of his shirt was received.&nbsp; What no
one has emphasized is that the police also didn't know they were
pursuing a serial killer (or even a killer, for that matter, when the
first APB went out).&nbsp; The police believed they were pursuing someone who
had just held up a cab and had shot the driver in the course of a
robbery.<br />
<br />
Serial killers tend to be white males (almost exclusively).<br />
<br />
The profile of your typical cab hold-up man is a lot more integrated, if you know what I mean.<br />
<br />
When Fouke explains why he didn't stop the man on Jackson Street, he
invariably mentions that Presidio Heights was an affluent neighborhood.&nbsp;
He doesn't just say, "We were looking for a black male and the
pedestrian was white."&nbsp; He says, "Seeing that it was a white male in an
affluent neighborhood walking along the street, we didn't think it was a
suspect."<br />
<br />
And, according to Pelissetti's account, the change in color of the APB
doesn't change Fouke's demeanor at all.&nbsp; It isn't that Fouke eliminated
the pedestrian because he was white, and the description was black.&nbsp;
It's that Fouke was looking for a taxi cab stick-up man, and the guy
Fouke saw obviously belonged in the neighborhood.&nbsp; And no one who lived
in the neighborhood held up cabs for a living.<br />
<br />
What saved the Zodiac killer wasn't a mistaken description; it was a mistaken preconception.<br />
<br />
Did Michael O'Hare take a chance that night, strolling through the
neighborhood?&nbsp; Maybe he did, but he had to make a couple points before
finally walking off the stage (publicly).</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<font style="font-size: 16px;">He shoots a man who has just put his cab in PARK.</font><br />
<div style="text-align: left;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
He talks about the cops searching the PARK properly.<br />
<br />
He says, If only the cops had PARKed their cars and just waited for him to come out of cover. <br />
<br />
And several times, he talks about making his way that night into the PARK.<br />
<br />
Do any of these references mean anything, or are they all a lot of PARK spelled backwards?<br />
<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>P &nbsp;&nbsp; A &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; R &nbsp; &nbsp; K<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 16 + 1&nbsp; + 18 + 11 = 46</b><br />
<br />
Yes, you guessed it, PARK is yet another reference to 2 x 23!&nbsp; But use
of the term points to the basic dichotomy between who the police thought
he was that night, and who he really was.&nbsp; A cab stick-up man, after a
botched robbery, would be stranded, and would have to hide in the PARK.&nbsp;
But someone who belonged in the neighborhood would simply walk to his
PARKed car.<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

In
Presidio Heights, with the murder of Paul Stine, the Zodiac killer moves into
a better neighborhood.&nbsp; That he takes a cab ride from the theatre district, and finally disappears, following his last
&#8220;public&#8221; murder, into quiet streets where doctors, lawyers, and other
professionals live, should serve as a hint, both of his theatrical intent, and of the neighborhoods of his
own private life.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">Maybe he was lucky that he made it back there safely?&nbsp; Or maybe, like the Dr. Jeckyll character in Robert Louis Stevenson's <b>The Strange Case of Dr. Jeckyll And Mr. Hyde</b>,
he needed only to reach those quiet streets, even in the midst of hot
pursuit by police after his alter-ego, to escape blind justice, and to
blend in with the upscale scenery?<br />
<br />
The reader may laugh at such a melodramatic idea, but I think Michael
O'Hare, as he disappears into the night, is laughing a lot harder.<br />

<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif" style="font-size: 18px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">The Presidio Heights killing of cab driver Paul Stine was the Zodiac
killer&#8217;s last &#8220;public&#8221; murder&#8212;his remaining four murders would all be
&#8220;secret&#8221;.<br />
<br />
As such, his final open killing is packed with information:<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>1. The Zodiac killer imitated pagan ritual by sacrificing &#8220;virgin&#8221; victims.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2. All victims were real or nominal virgins&#8212;like Paul Stine on Cherry St..<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3. He hacked Stine&#8217;s shirt off so he didn&#8217;t need a gun linking his crimes.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4. He pulled Stine&#8217;s body over onto the passenger side of the front seat.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;5. The Zodiac killer strapped a Timex stopped at 1:46 onto Paul Stine&#8217;s wrist.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;6. The Zodiac killer used a .38, NOT a 9mm., to kill Paul Stine.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;7. The gun numbers, read in sequence, spell his name backwards.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;8. 22-9-45-38 converts to a form of his name&#8212;ER/HO&#8212;which is also 23/23.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9. Michael O&#8217;Hare varied his m. o. because his initials are M. O..<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 10. The car sequence, going forward or in reverse, spells out his DOB.<br />
<br />
&nbsp; 11. He doesn't NEED a disguise in Presidio Heights; he looks like he belongs there.</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Robert Graysmith describes the crime scene at Washington &amp; Cherry as having been lit up like broad daylight.<br />
<br />
We now move out of the starlight, and into the dark side of the Zodiac killer.<br />
