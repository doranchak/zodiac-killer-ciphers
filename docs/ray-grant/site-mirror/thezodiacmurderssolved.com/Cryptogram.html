<div style="text-align: left;">
<div style="text-align: center;">
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">I divide all cryptography into three categories:<br />
</font></div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
</font><br />
a. <b>Serious Cryptography</b>, which is the kind used by intelligence
bureaus of governments and by security departments of big companies.&nbsp;
The Purple Code and The Japanese Naval Code are examples of Serious
Cryptography, which The Zodiac Project isn't . . . as far as I can tell.<br />
<br />
b. <b>Baby Block Cryptography</b>, which is the kind found on the puzzle
page of most newspapers.&nbsp; Most of the cryptographic insights made in
this book are examples of Baby Block (for example, the most basic kind
of letter-to-number code is A=1, B=2, C=3, and this very simple
conversion is what's used for most of the Zodiac killer's major points).<br />
<br />
and c. <b>Decoder Ring Cryptography</b>, which is Baby Block taken a step or two further, of which The Cryptogram is an example.<br />
<br />
Earlier versions of this book contained Decoder Ring Analysis of all the
Zodiac documents.&nbsp; I literally digitized every single Zodiac letter and
message, scanned them using the SEARCH function of my word processor,
and highlighted the most interesting results in a grid on the page.&nbsp; If I
end up doing anything like that in this edition, it will be in the form
of an image scan of the earlier material.&nbsp; In any case, I've come to
the conclusion, after twenty years and several editions of this book,
that my time is better served trying to explain:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
a, WHAT the Zodiac killer was doing; <br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
b, WHY he was doing it; and<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
c, in some cases, HOW he was doing it.<br />
<br />
But I do have to take out my Decoder Ring to deal with The Cryptogram,
so I'll try to make this chapter as painless as possible (it may still
hurt, though).</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Cryptogram Facts</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">1. On August 1, 1969, The Vallejo Times-Herald, The San Francisco
Examiner, and The San Francisco Chronicle each received one-third of a
cryptogram, postmarked the day before.&nbsp; The cover letter for each was
essentially the same message with minor variations.<br />
<br />
2. Each third was 8 lines by 17 columns, the total cipher consisting of 24 lines of 17 characters.<br />
<br />
3. The language of the cover letters lacked verbal sophistication,
yet the cipher itself was clever enough to frustrate the CIA, FBI, NSA,
and other experts.<br />
<br />
4. The Salinas couple who did come up with the solution--Donald
Harden and his wife Bettye--commented on how cleverly The Cryptogram
was constructed, in such a way as to discourage easy deciphering.&nbsp; A
local expert on codes agreed that the Zodiac killer obviously &#8220;knew his
business&#8221; when it came to constructing ciphers.<br />
<br />
5. Nonetheless, the solution disappointed both the Hardens and
police.&nbsp; The plaintext message was nothing more than a
theme-and-variations on his motives for murder (I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE
BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH FUN . . . ),<br />
<br />
6. The Zodiac killer had apparently been bluffing about the cipher containing
his name, unless the gibberish at the end (EBEORIETEMETHHPITI) was an
anagram for his signature.</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Cryptogram Non-Facts</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Four aspects of The Cryptogram were misunderstood at the time of its publication:<br />
<br />
<b>1. The cipher as published wasn&#8217;t what the Zodiac killer sent.<br />
<br />
2. The Zodiac killer never actually said his name was in the cipher.<br />
<br />
3. The MOST misleading aspect of the cipher was the &#8220;solved&#8221; part.<br />
<br />
4. The form of the cipher was almost more important than its content.</b></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><b><br />
</b><br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Cryptogram Non-Solution</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
If The Cryptogram contained clues to its solution, it also featured many
hints about the kind of person(s) who composed it.&nbsp; For example, The
Cryptogram was a multiple-substitution cipher with seven different
symbols representing the most common letter, &#8216;E&#8217;.<br />
<br />
The &#8220;solved&#8221; message, on the other hand, was childlike in its simplicity.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH FUN . . . <br />
</b>
<br />
Shouldn&#8217;t someone have come out and said, &#8220;It can&#8217;t be that simple?&#8221;&nbsp; No
one goes to that much trouble to convey such an idiotic message!<br />
<br />
When NASA sent Voyager out beyond the solar system, the accompanying
disc didn&#8217;t consist entirely of a sound recording of &#8220;When You Wish Upon
A Star.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Maybe it should have?&nbsp; Voyager might land on a planet like ours, be
confiscated by the local police, and they may not &#8220;get&#8221; the BINARY
message that was on the real disc!</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Whose Puzzle?</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
I&nbsp; can&#8217;t present the Harden solution to The Cryptogram . . . because it&#8217;s wrong.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s not that the Hardens themselves did anything wrong, they were just
working on something that WASN&#8217;T the Zodiac&#8217;s Cryptogram.&nbsp; Here is what I
believe the Zodiac killer actually sent, as copied from Gareth Penn's <b>Times 17</b>:</font></font></font></font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<div style="text-align: center;"></div>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/e6fca07bec11d4c8a08418194e0552c6.png"  /><br />

<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Apparently, between the time The Cryptogram was received (Friday,
August 1, 1969) and when the entire thing was published (Sunday, August
3, 1969), police changed at least 19 symbols of the original grid:</font></font></font></font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/e458a8bb55361331eb59303039292cf4.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Whoever did it did a good job--the rank and file of the cipher grid was
maintained, and more than half the changes involved simply filling in
empty square symbols.&nbsp; My guess is, the substitution was done by a
police sketch artist.&nbsp; Police do things like this so that if the real
Zodiac comes forward and says, &#8220;Hey that&#8217;s not what I sent you,&#8221; they&#8217;ve
got him!<br />
<br />
I know this because Gareth Penn used a slightly different set of symbols from the ones shown in Graysmith&#8217;s <b>Zodiac</b>,
presumably because his father was in law enforcement and had access to
the originals (though I don&#8217;t recall Gareth ever actually explaining
this):</font></font></font></font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

</font>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">I&#8217;m doing the method of change here off the top of my head, so I don&#8217;t swear by the accuracy of each individual change.&nbsp; Remember, Gareth&#8217;s symbols were the originals; Graysmith&#8217;s were post-change.<br />

</b><br />
Two quick quibbles:<br />
<br />
1, Gareth Penn has backward-F in Line 6, Columns 2 and 7 of The SFC;
Graysmith has backward-E.&nbsp; As you can see, I circled the second instance
in my earlier editions (scanned above).&nbsp; I'm inclined to think Gareth
simply mistyped, since otherwise one would have to substitute DOLLEDTING
for COLLECTING.&nbsp; Further analysis is called for here, but I don't have
time to do it right now, and I doubt that the difference would be worth
my delaying the rest of the book for (but I've been wrong before).<br />
<br />
2, Michael Rodelli has made the interesting suggestion that police may
have solved The Cryptogram on Friday or Saturday and THEN changed the
symbol grid for the Sunday paper to trick the killer into coming forward
with his own (corrected) solution.&nbsp; Mike bases this insight on the fact
that at least one of the changes (WILE to WILL) corrects a misspelling
in the cipher text.&nbsp; If he's right, it makes the script of David
Fincher's movie, which makes fun of the cipher being solved in the
breakfast nook of the Hardens, look foolish.<br />
<br />
In any case, without going into cryptographic detail, it&#8217;s clear that
Gareth&#8217;s version of The Cryptogram is more internally consistent, so
that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going with:<br />
<br />
<b>I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH FUN.&nbsp; IT IS MORE FUN THAN
KILLING WILD GAME IN THE FORREST BECAUSE MAN IS THE MOST DANGERTUE
ANIMAL OE ALL.&nbsp; TO KILL SOMETHING GIVES ME THE MOST THRILLING
EXPERENCE.&nbsp; IT IS EVEN BETTER THAN GETTING YOUR ROCKS OFF WITH A GIRL.&nbsp;
THE BEST PART OF IT IS THAE WHEN I DIE I WILL BE REBORN IN PARADICE AND
ALL THE I HAVE KILLED WILL BECOME MY SLAVES.&nbsp; I WILE NOT GIVE YOU MY
NAME BECAUSE YOU WILL TRY TO SLOI DOWN OR STOP MY COLLECTING OF SLAVES
FOR MY AFTERLIFE.&nbsp; EBEORIETEMETHHPITI</b><br />
<br />
I realize some readers are going to drily remark, after a quick
comparison, that the difference between versions wasn&#8217;t worth commenting
on.&nbsp; And for the purposes of this book, they&#8217;re right.&nbsp; The differences
are subtle enough that I won&#8217;t end up discussing them here.&nbsp; But since
we&#8217;re dealing with what cryptographers call a &#8220;two-step cipher&#8221;, where
the apparent solution is just the middle step in the process, even a
small change could affect the final reading.&nbsp; And since I&#8217;m going to use
the correct solution, I thought I&#8217;d explain why.<br />
<br />

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
Sometimes the Zodiac killer sent the most important clue to one of his
mysteries in the next mailing or shortly thereafter.&nbsp; For instance, he
sent The Mt. Diablo Code in his letter of June 26, 1970, and then
mentioned radians in the postscript of a letter the following month
(July 25, 1970).&nbsp; In the very next letter after The Cryptogram (August
7, 1969), he called himself &#8216;the Zodiac&#8217; for the first time:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;This is the Zodiac speaking.</b><br />
<br />
One would assume he reserved this nominal coming-out party for some
significant information.&nbsp; True to form, he gave it to us
parenthetically:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>By the way, are the police<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;haveing a good time with the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;code?&nbsp; If not, tell them to cheer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;up; when they do crack it<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;they will have me.</b><br />
<br />
In the four decades since this letter was sent, people have assumed that
the Zodiac killer was merely amusing himself.&nbsp; After all, the last full
sentence of The Cryptogram solution says, like a surprise punchline,
that he will NOT give his name.<br />
<br />
<b>I WILE NOT GIVE YOU MY NAME BECAUSE YOU WILL TRY TO SLOI DOWN OR STOP MY COLLECTING OF SLAVES FOR MY AFTERLIFE.</b><br />
<br />
But he never said The Cryptogram contained his NAME.&nbsp; He said<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;In this cipher is my identity.</b><br />
<br />
Your identity can consist of any number of things besides your name.<br />
The Zodiac killer isn&#8217;t telling us his name.&nbsp; He&#8217;s telling us who he is.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>are the police<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;haveing a good time with the<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;code?</b><br />
<br />
Note that he uses the word &#8216;code&#8217;.&nbsp; The Cryptogram isn&#8217;t a code; it&#8217;s an
independently encrypted document--a &#8216;cipher&#8217;.&nbsp; A code is a general
system of encryption.&nbsp; So he&#8217;s not really talking about The Cryptogram
itself.&nbsp; He&#8217;s saying, "Have you figured out my language yet?" Figure out
his language, and you&#8217;ll figure out who he is.<br />
<br />

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
So The Cryptogram was just a big joke, right?&nbsp; A big build-up to an idiotic payoff?<br />
<br />
Not exactly.&nbsp; Remember, both the Hardens and the professional
codebreakers who studied The Cryptogram found it to be cryptographically
sophisticated.&nbsp; So . . . does it make sense that someone smart enough
to construct a multiple substitution cipher--one using seven different
symbols for the letter E in a meticulously repeating sequence--would
then make use of that complex mechanism to gush ungrammatically about
the joys of multiple murder?<br />
<br />
No.&nbsp; But he might do that if The Cryptogram were really a two-step cipher.<br />
<br />
A two-step cipher has three layers.&nbsp; On top is the cipher text, also
called the cover text.&nbsp; Even when you decipher it correctly, the
solution is disappointing, because it&#8217;s only the first stage of a
two-step process.&nbsp; You either get what looks like gibberish
(EBEORIETEMETHHPITI), or you get an innocuous message (I LIKE KILLING
PEOPLE . . . ).&nbsp; You only get the real solution when you go that second
step.<br />
<br />
<b>CIPHER TEXT&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Cryptogram symbols<br />

So . . . why don&#8217;t we try out this revolutionary idea?&nbsp; Let&#8217;s use some
of our decoding methods on The Cryptogram&#8217;s &#8220;solution&#8221;, and see if we
get a different message entirely!<br />

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE</b><br />
<br />
Oddly enough, I don&#8217;t think this is true.&nbsp; In the one non-shooting
murder for which we have a witness, Lake Berryessa, the Zodiac killer
seems almost to be forcing himself to go through with it.&nbsp; Bryan
Hartnell describes a Zodiac who says little, acts mechanically, and
breathes hard throughout his stabbing attack.&nbsp; Hardly the impression a
cackling, orgiastic killer would make!<br />
<br />
Nevertheless, something about those first two words is familiar!<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>I &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; LIKE<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; L&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; K&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; E<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 12 + 9 + 11 + 5 = 37<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; LIKE<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9 +&nbsp; 37&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; =&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;46</b>
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
The first thing we notice is that I LIKE adds up to 46 in alphabet
numbers.&nbsp; So he&#8217;s starting off the document with a form of 2 x 23.&nbsp; That
in itself would seem to indicate we&#8217;re on the right track!&nbsp; But let&#8217;s
look again.&nbsp; Remember what we said about the scorecard number at the
bottom of the Zodiac killer&#8217;s Exorcist Letter?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Me - 37</b><br />
<br />
The Zodiac killer usually uses one of two numbers, 6 or 9, to equate
himself to something.&nbsp; The number 6 is Morse/binary ME; the number 9 is
the 9th letter, &#8216;I&#8217;.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>I &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; LIKE<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;9&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;37</b><br />
<br />
Again, he&#8217;s making the same statement he made to equate himself to pi:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;I (am) 37.</b><br />
<br />
I. e., &#8220; I am pi,&#8221; or 3 followed by 7 decimal digits which spells ZODIAC.&nbsp; I will come back to this in a moment.</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Let&#8217;s look at the next two words, using the same approach:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>KILLING PEOPLE</b><br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>K&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; L&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; L&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; N&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;G<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;11 + 9 + 12 + 12 + 9 + 14 + 7&nbsp; =&nbsp; 74<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; P&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; E&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; P&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; L&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;E<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;16 +&nbsp; 5 + 15 + 16 + 12 + 5&nbsp; =&nbsp; 69<br />
</b>
<br />
<b>KILLING PEOPLE</b> just happens to add up to <b>74-69</b>.&nbsp; Or, to add a dash of emphasis, <b>7-4-69</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>7-4-69</b> would indicate <b>July 4th, 1969</b>.<br />
<br />
Remember, I said the Darlene Ferrin murder actually took place a few
minutes after midnight on July 5th, 1969, but the Zodiac killer kept
insisting in his letters that it happened on July 4th?&nbsp; Now you know why
the Zodiac killer wanted the Ferrin murder to happen on July 4th, 1969.<br />
<br />
So that, on that day, he would be KILLING PEOPLE!</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Mistakes</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Gareth Penn once said that the Zodiac killer intended to kill Darlene
Ferrin on July 4, 1969, but wasn&#8217;t quite able to manage it.&nbsp; I now
suspect the Zodiac intentionally waited until after midnight to shoot
the couple in the Blue Rock Springs parking lot.&nbsp; If you watch David
Fincher&#8217;s movie <b>Zodiac</b><u>,</u> you will see the Zodiac killer
pull into the parking lot behind them, then drive off, then come back
and start shooting.&nbsp; Partly this is because there has to be some
voluntary aspect to what the victims do, in keeping with the pagan
sacrifice rituals, a subject which I will cover in a later section.&nbsp; I.
e., he has to give them a chance to drive away.<br />
<br />
Since the victims don&#8217;t know he&#8217;s about to start shooting them, he&#8217;s not
giving them much of a chance, but there has to be at least the
appearance of compliance on their part (in keeping with their being
voluntary passengers).<br />
<br />
The same is true of other victims.&nbsp; Cheri Bates appears to have walked
off with her killer.&nbsp; Her killer even says, in The Confession Letter,
&#8220;SHE WENT VERY WILLINGLY.&#8221;&nbsp; David Faraday and Betty Lou Jensen
apparently chose to park in that spot along Lake Herman Road.&nbsp; Paul
Stine let the Zodiac killer into his car and then went where the Zodiac
killer told him to go.&nbsp; Again, these victims were unaware of what was in
store for them, so their actions weren&#8217;t really voluntary, but they
SEEMED to cooperate in their fate.<br />
<br />
But the more immediate reason to wait until after midnight to begin
shooting is that it allows him to call attention to his mistake.&nbsp; Thus,
neither of the &#8220;dates&#8221; given in The Cryptogram cover letters, or in the
follow-up &#8220;This is the Zodiac speaking" Letter of August 4, 1969, is
accurate.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Christmass&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4th July</b><br />
<br />
Those are both wrong.&nbsp; The &#8220;Christmas&#8221; murders actually took place on December 20, 1968.<br />
And the July 4th murder took place in the early minutes of July 5, 1969.<br />
<br />
The Zodiac killer used apparent mistakes to call attention to some aspect of his scheme.<br />
I will point out other such &#8220;mistakes&#8221; as we stumble over them.</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Three Parts</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
Just in case you were wondering, he divides The Cryptogram into 3 parts because the Devil in <b>Dante&#8217;s Inferno</b> has three heads.&nbsp; Metaphorically, it&#8217;s just that simple.<br />
<br />
But another, more practical reason to do it is that newspapers are in
competition with one another.&nbsp; When The Vallejo Times-Herald, The San
Francisco Examiner, and The San Francisco Chronicle all receive a third
of a killer&#8217;s cryptogram, one of the three papers is bound to publish
it.&nbsp; And once that happens, the other two will follow suit.<br />
<br />
The Zodiac killer could not take the chance with this, his most
important piece of information, that the publication might come down to
editorial whim.&nbsp; So he divides The Cryptogram into three pieces and
sends it off to the three major newspapers in the San Francisco Bay
Area.&nbsp; David Fincher&#8217;s movie has several scenes devoted to the editorial
decision, on the part of The San Francisco Chronicle, to publish the
letter.</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">390 18</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
I mentioned that the Zodiac killer never said The Cryptogram contained
his name, i. e., it doesn&#8217;t contain 'Michael O&#8217;Hare'.&nbsp; However, he did
say The Cryptogram contained his identity.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;&#8220;I (am) pi.&#8221;</b><br />
<br />
Again, he is pi because the binary/Morse form of pi spells out<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>M.ERAHO</b>.<br />
<br />
So there must be a reference to pi in The Cryptogram.&nbsp; And there is.&nbsp; I
already mentioned that the first two words of the solution,<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>I LIKE</b>,<br />
<br />
--actually means<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>&#8220;I (am) pi.&#8221;</b><br />
<br />
But the FORM of The Cryptogram says the same thing.&nbsp; It consists of 390
characters of a statement (I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE . . .), followed by 18
characters of apparent gibberish (EBEORIETEMETHHPITI).&nbsp; The closest one
can come to the relationship between 3 and .1415926 in 408 characters is
to divide them 390/18.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#247;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;.1415926&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;=&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;21.1875 . . .</b> &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
<br />

<br />
The form of The Cryptogram is itself a representation of pi.<br />

<br />
Ready for something a bit more challenging?<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s time we tackled one of the great unsolved mysteries of the Zodiac
case&#8212;those final 18 letters of The Cryptogram, EBEORIETEMETHHPITI.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">18 Letters</font> </div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
One
could argue that the entire Zodiac mystery comes down to a group of 18
seemingly random letters at the end of The Cryptogram.<br />
<br />
<b>EBEORIETEMETHHPITI</b><br />
<br />
If you Google those 18 letters, you will be escorted to various "Zodiac
killer"-related sites, most of which simply report that the passage was
found at the end of the first Zodiac killer cipher, some of which
actually attempt to decipher it . . . or at least, make the first
rudimentary steps toward a solution.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s therefore make some basic
assumptions about it:<br />
<br />
1, That the Zodiac killer might sign the message with an anagram of his
own name is perfectly reasonable.&nbsp; For example, one group of
&#8220;Zodiologists&#8221; believes the Zodiac killer was also The Unabomber.&nbsp; They
believe the 18 letters convert to his name (including his middle
initial):<br />
<br />
<b>THEODORE J. KACZYNSKI</b><br />
<br />
2, The idea that the letters at the end simply fill out the grid is also reasonable.<br />
<br />
I believe that, like all messages from the Zodiac killer, there was a
dual purpose to those 18 letters.&nbsp; The sudden intrusion, following 390
characters that make some sort of sense, of 18 letters that don&#8217;t, may
serve as the most blatant indicator that what the reader assumed WAS a
solution WASN&#8217;T a solution.&nbsp; It also follows that the perfect
misdirection would be to have the public breathlessly read the apparent
solution, then dismiss it because it contained no significant
information, only to have the significant information hidden underneath.<br />
<br />
There&#8217;s a term for this in the world of cryptography.&nbsp; It&#8217;s called a Two-Step Cipher.<br />
And the 18 letters are a blinking neon sign advertising its presence.<br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Final Message</font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Why go to the trouble of composing a multiple substitution cipher which
has a straightforward--if anticlimactic--solution, and then dividing it
into three parts and mailing it to three newspapers in the metropolitan
area with as much menacing fanfare as you can drum up . . . if you&#8217;re
going to leave 18 letters at the end that don&#8217;t mean anything?<br />
<br />
<b>EBEORIETEMETHHPITI</b><br />
<br />
Obviously, you wouldn&#8217;t want to do that.&nbsp; So we have to assume, unless
the Zodiac killer was just &#8220;haveing some fun&#8221; with us (as he did at the
phone booth with the Vallejo cop), that The 18 Letters are perhaps even
more significant than anything else he&#8217;s told us.<br />
<br />
The odd thing about The 18 Letters is that they&#8217;re designed to mean
nothing on the surface--their apparent lack of meaning is itself a
clue--but beneath the surface, they reveal the ultimate ends of The
Zodiac Project.<br />
<br />
The 18 Letters are meant, first of all, to indicate that what follows
The Cryptogram will not be a superficially straightforward message as
the first 390 characters are.&nbsp; In other words, they are a blatant
indication that what I said in the previous chapter is true, that The
Cryptogram is a two-step cipher.&nbsp; Any attempt to solve it using
conventional methods will eventually break down, and leave you with an
inane message which seems to say very little.<br />
<br />
This essentially prepares the way for The 340-Character Cipher, which
never had a straightforward solution . . . and wasn&#8217;t even meant to be
deciphered.<br />
<br />
I will discuss The 340 when we get to it.&nbsp; For now, let&#8217;s decipher The 18 Letters.</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />

</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Three Sections</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font style="font-size: 16px;">And now, as we used to say back in the &#8216;50s, the $64,000 Question: </font><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
What do The 18 Letters at the end of The Cryptogram really mean?<br />
<br />
<b>EBEORIETEMETHHPITI<br />
</b><br />
Okay, this is a mystery that&#8217;s lasted 40 years.&nbsp; My high school class
didn&#8217;t even wait that long to hold its 40th reunion!&nbsp; It&#8217;s time somebody
solved this thing!<br />
<br />
And no, it&#8217;s NOT an anagram of the killer&#8217;s name.<br />
<br />
The 18 Letters come at the end of the Zodiac killer&#8217;s very first
cipher.&nbsp; They tell you what&#8217;s going to happen at the end of The Zodiac
Project.<br />
<br />
<b>EBEORIETEMETHHPITI</b><br />
<br />
Like The Cryptogram itself, I&#8217;m going to divide the 18 Letters into three parts, but in this case they&#8217;re not equal:<br />
<br />
<b>E&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;BEORIET&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;EMETHHPITI<br />
1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 10</b><br />
<br />
There are three sections but only two significant expressions.&nbsp; Note,
incidentally, that the final two sections add up to 17, and represent
the same number of stab wounds administered to Bryan Hartnell (7) and
Cecelia Ann Shepard (10) at Lake Berryessa a couple of months later.<br />
<br />
And no, that&#8217;s NOT a coincidence.</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">First Letter</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><b>E<br />
0</b><br />
<br />
The initial E is actually just a place-holder, though it may also be
intended to provide symmetry with the final Morse/binary character (a
zero).&nbsp; Remember, The Cryptogram, once its three parts were put
together, consisted of 24 lines of 17 characters apiece.<br />
<br />
In the cipher text of The Cryptogram, this first character is the last
symbol at the end of line 23.&nbsp; It is character 17 of line 23.&nbsp; Since we
know that the fundamental design of The Zodiac Project is a dichotomy of
23/23, a closing message that begins at the very end of Line 23 would
seem appropriate, particularly since we're dealing with someone who led a
normal life for his first 23 years, and then intended to be a notorious
killer for his remaining 23 years.&nbsp; There has to be a connection,
however brief, to that first half of his life, so that we're aware of
the dichotomy.<br />
<br />
Note, also, that this symbol occurs immediately following the word<br />
<br />
<b>AFTERLIFE.</b><br />
<br />
If the Zodiac Project&#8217;s fundamental design element is symmetry, then a
message that concerns events at the end of his life would be appropriate
following the word AFTERLIFE, correct?<br />
<br />
<br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Next Seven Letters</font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
Let&#8217;s look at the second section of the message:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<b>B&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; E&nbsp; O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; E T<br />
1000&nbsp; 0 111 010 00 0 1<br />
<br />
100 0 01 1<br />
<br />
D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; E&nbsp; A&nbsp; T&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(H)<br />
100 0 01&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(0000)</b><br />
<br />
The Zodiac killer sometimes used shortened forms of his favorite
Morse/binary expressions; I think this is the only example I cite in
this book, but I&#8217;m calling attention to it because it&#8217;s crucial to the
reading.&nbsp; The justification for using any such shortened form is that
what follows it are binary zeroes, which are just two-multipliers.&nbsp; In
other words, eliminate all trailing zeroes and you have the Morse/binary
&#8220;root&#8221; of the word. <br />
<br />
DEATH isn&#8217;t used in its normal Morse/binary form (10000110000) because
the Zodiac killer wants it to overlap with another expression in binary
math:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><b>B&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; E&nbsp;&nbsp; O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp; E T<br />
1000&nbsp; 0 111 010 00 0 1</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
10000 111 010 00 0 1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
1110100001 = 929</b><br />
<br />
So--long story short--the first of two messages is:<br />

Anyone familiar with the Zodiac killer should know what DEATH means by
now, but what does &#8216;929&#8217; mean?&nbsp; Is it a date, or a time?&nbsp; If &#8216;929&#8217; were a
date, 9-29, it would be September 29th, which is the day on the
Catholic Calendar reserved for St. Michael, Michaelmas.&nbsp; Since our
suspect&#8217;s first name is Michael, that might indicate we&#8217;re on the right
track.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, for a killer who draws designs on USGS quadrangles,
929 seems more likely to be a destination than a date or time--Highway
929 to Hell.<br />
<br />
<b>DEATH/929 </b>really means<b> &#8220;Death in Room 929, MIT Tower&#8221;.</b><br />
<br />
And yes, I&#8217;m talking about the same MIT Tower featured so prominently in Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s Progressive Architecture article.<br />

example of temporal symmetry.<br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Final Ten Letters</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
Now let&#8217;s look at the 3rd section:<br />
<br />
<b>E&nbsp; M&nbsp; E&nbsp; T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; P&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; T&nbsp; I<br />
0&nbsp; 11&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 0000 0000 0110&nbsp; 00 1 00</b><br />
<br />
Although I&#8217;m expressing the Morse code values here with binary digits
(instead of dots and dashes), I&#8217;m going to translate this passage using
straightforward Morse redivision, except for the final binary zero.<br />
<br />
Does the reader understand what I mean by redivision?<br />
If not, here&#8217;s an example, in English, from my childhood:<br />
<br />
There was a local Pittsburgh kid&#8217;s show back in the late 50s or early
60s called The Paul Shannon Show, which featured shorts by The Three
Stooges and a character who resembled Claude Rains in The Invisible Man,
with airplane goggles and a trench coat.&nbsp; The character&#8217;s name was
Nosmo King, and between shorts the character would be seen sneaking onto
the set and scrawling the message NOSMO WAS HERE on a wall.&nbsp; I suppose
the message was supposed to be subliminal, but it wasn&#8217;t until I was in
my 30s that I finally realized<br />
<br />
<b>NOSMO KING </b>was actually<b> NO SMOKING!</b> <br />
<br />
It&#8217;s the same set of letters in the same sequence, but divided
differently, as a result of which, you get a completely different
message.&nbsp; That&#8217;s all we&#8217;re doing with Morse redivision; the same
sequence, but divided differently so that it spells something completely
different.<br />
<br />
<b>E&nbsp; M&nbsp; E&nbsp; T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; H&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; H&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; P&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp; T &nbsp; I<br />
0&nbsp; 11&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 0000&nbsp; 0000&nbsp; 0110&nbsp; 00&nbsp; 1&nbsp; 00<br />
<br />
01&nbsp; 10&nbsp;&nbsp; 100&nbsp; 00&nbsp; 000&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp; 110 0&nbsp; 010&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0<br />
A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; N&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;E&nbsp; E&nbsp;&nbsp; G&nbsp;&nbsp; E &nbsp;&nbsp; R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; (x2)</b>
<br />
<br />
So the 3rd expression is:<br />
<br />
<b>EMETHHPITI = AND I, SEEGER (x2)</b><br />
<br />
The (x2) is there after SEEGER because there&#8217;s a trailing 0 after the
SEEGER digits, and trailing 0s in binary math are two-multipliers.</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><b>AND I, SEEGER (x2)</b> is yet another literary reference.<br />
<br />
Alan Seeger was an American poet born in 1888.&nbsp; Like Michael O&#8217;Hare, he
was born in New York City, and like Michael O'Hare, he went to Harvard.&nbsp;
Unlike Michael O&#8217;Hare, he fought and died in WWI and was buried in a
mass grave in France.&nbsp; Alan Seeger&#8217;s nephew is the folk singer Pete
Seeger, who wrote &#8220;Where Have All The Flowers Gone?&#8221;, an anti-war song
about soldiers dying for nothing.<br />
<br />
Alan Seeger&#8217;s most famous poem was also JFK&#8217;s favorite, the
appropriately (for both men) fatalistic &#8220;I Have A Rendezvous With
Death&#8221;.&nbsp; Because the poem figures so prominently at this point in the
Zodiac killer literature, I&#8217;m going to quote the entire thing:<br />
<br />
<b>I Have A Rendezvous With Death by Alan Seeger<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a rendezvous with Death <br />
&nbsp;
2&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At some disputed barricade, <br />
&nbsp;
3&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When Spring comes back with rustling shade <br />
&nbsp;
4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And apple-blossoms fill the air <br />
&nbsp;
5&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a rendezvous with Death <br />
&nbsp;
6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When Spring brings back blue days and fair. <br />
&nbsp;
7&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It may be he shall take my hand <br />
&nbsp;
8&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And lead me into his dark land <br />
&nbsp; 9&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And close my eyes and quench my breath <br />
10&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;It may be I shall pass him still. <br />
11&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I have a rendezvous with Death <br />
12&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;On some scarred slope of battered hill, <br />
13&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When Spring comes round again this year <br />
14&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And the first meadow-flowers appear. <br />
<br />
15&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;God knows 'twere better to be deep <br />
16&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pillowed in silk and scented down, <br />
17&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Where Love throbs out in blissful sleep, <br />
18&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Pulse nigh to pulse, and breath to breath, <br />
19&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Where hushed awakenings are dear... <br />
20&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;But I've a rendezvous with Death <br />
21&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;At midnight in some flaming town, <br />
22&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;When Spring trips north again this year, <br />
23&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;And I to my pledged word am true, <br />
24&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;I shall not fail that rendezvous.</b><br />
<br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 24px;"></font></font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">SEEGER</font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">I believe the Zodiac killer is referring to the beginning of Line 23 (of
all lines!) when he says AND I, SEEGER.&nbsp; Note, incidentally, the
symmetry in a message that begins at the end of one Line 23 (the last
character of The Cryptogram's next-to-last line), and ends at the
beginning of another Line 23 (the first character of the Seeger poem's
next-to-last line).&nbsp; In other words, the source for the allusion is
bracketed by two 23s.<br />
<br />
There can be no mistake about his intention.<br />
<br />
<b>And I to my pledged word am true, <br />
I shall not fail that rendezvous.</b><br />
<br />
I. e., the Zodiac killer has a rendezvous with death.<br />
At a specific time, on a specific day.<br />
And he intends to go out with a very big bang!<br />
<br />
The police and public only saw the preliminary solution of a two-step
cipher, and decided that the Zodiac killer was playing some silly game
with them.&nbsp; The correct, second-step solution shows that he is deadly
serious. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
<b>Seeger (x2)</b><br />
<br />
As it happens, Alan Seeger was born on 73rd Street in NYC.&nbsp; Remember the
trailing binary zero after his name?&nbsp; 73rd Street (times two) equals
146.&nbsp; Since &#8216;146&#8217; is the last thing he says in The Cryptogram, the
reader may rest assured that &#8220;146&#8221; is his final destination.<br />
<br />
But wait--he intends DEATH in Room 929 of The MIT Tower?<br />
<br />
And then schedules a rendezvous with DEATH at &#8220;146&#8221;?<br />
<br />
If you can&#8217;t be in two places at once, how can you die in two places?<br />
<br />
I will address this issue in The April 1970 Letters.&nbsp; But
suffice it to say that if the chief design element of The Zodiac Project
is symmetry, where everything happens in twos, and the project will
come to an end with a very big bang in 1989, then logically that end
would come in not one, but two, places.</font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Anagrams?</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">Meanwhile, to those of you who were disappointed when I said that The 18
Letters were NOT an anagram of the killer&#8217;s name, do what the Zodiac
killer suggests and cheer up!&nbsp; The Zodiac killer DID spell out his name .
. . just not in The Cryptogram.<br />
<br />
He did it in a much more prominent place.<br />
<br />
All right, I&#8217;ll give you a hint.&nbsp; There&#8217;s something he&#8217;s doing here in
The Cryptogram cover letters that doesn&#8217;t make any sense, if you think
about it.&nbsp; In fact, he&#8217;s about to risk arrest at a crime scene in the
very near future, just to cover up the fact that he&#8217;s spelling out his
name.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ll give you another hint.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the first thing I ever noticed about
the Zodiac murders, and I noticed it in 1986, long before I suspected
Gareth Penn of being involved.&nbsp; It&#8217;s the thing that made me think other
people following the case just weren&#8217;t paying attention.&nbsp; So--if you&#8217;re
paying attention, see if you can find it before I show it to you!</font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">18 Letters Review</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">Although the solution to the mystery of The 18 Letters isn&#8217;t as
straightforward as some people might have liked&#8212;it isn&#8217;t an anagram of
the killer&#8217;s name&#8212;it&#8217;s also not at all complicated.<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<b>1. The 18 Letters are there to tell us The Cryptogram is a 2-Step Cipher.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
2. The 18 Letters are split into 3 sections: E, BEORIET, and EMETHHPITI.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
3. The letter E is simply a place-holder which mirrors the final binary 0.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
4. The letter E does, however, come at the <i>end</i> of Line 23 of the cipher.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
5. BEORIET translates to the overlapping phrase DEATH/929.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
6. DEATH/929 means &#8220;Death in Room 929 of The MIT Tower.&#8221;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
7. EMETHHPITI translates by Morse redivision to AND I, SEEGER (x2).<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
8. AND I, SEEGER (x2) means &#8220;I Have A Rendezvous With Death,&#8221; at 146.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
9. AND I comes at the <i>beginning</i> of Line 23 of the poem.<br />
<br />
10. The Zodiac killer WAS spelling out his name&#8212;but in another prominent place!<br />
</b><br />
<br />
For more clues to this last point, we move to the murder at Lake Berryessa.<br />
