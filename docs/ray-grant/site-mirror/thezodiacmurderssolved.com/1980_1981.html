<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/dcde8b5573120cd48d175e037bd8a77d.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
Gareth and I have never met in person (to my knowledge), but I became aware of Gareth because he wrote an article in the July/August 1985 issue of <b>The Mensa Bulletin</b> entitled &#8220;The Calculus of Evil&#8221; which featured, in bowdlerized form to protect Mensa from a possible lawsuit, his theory of the real intent behind the Zodiac murders.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/aa0e86f869795a199078fdd9d61a2988_8f8q.jpg"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
At the end of that article, the editor, Kent Van Cleave, added a footnote on Gareth&#8217;s background, concluding with:<br />
<br />
<b>We are omitting references that specifically identify his suspect, which may be frustrating to curious readers.  Penn, however, has gone public with his identification of the Zodiac, and will expand on the conclusions offered here for any Mensans who send a SASE to him at the above address.</b><br />
<br />
After reading the article, I immediately wrote to Gareth, and began a correspondence by letter and telephone, which lasted the better part of four years (almost five if you count Gareth&#8217;s letter of May 22, 1990).<br />
<br />
I will discuss what Gareth sent to me in the SASE when we get to that part of the story.<br />
<br />
In 2010, Gareth made a rather lame attempt to misrepresent our relationship on his anonymous blog (his name is nowhere to be found on it), <a href="http://gz4216.blogspot.com/">GZ4216</a>:<br />
<br />
<b>Ray Grant is just one of hundreds of people with whom I corresponded a quarter century ago, most of whose names I have not retained. I would not characterize him as a &#8220;friend.&#8221;</b><br />
<br />
One can&#8217;t help being struck by how many of the investigators and journalists Gareth encountered in <b>Times 17</b> with whom he is no longer on speaking terms at the end of the book; it&#8217;s pretty much all of them.  Add to that group myself, since I choose NOT to count serial killers among my friends, and Gareth&#8217;s spouse at the time, Diane Merrill, who managed to obtain a rather nasty divorce from my erstwhile friend some years later, in the process somehow holding onto the house she&#8217;d bought with her own money before taking in her homeless husband . . . and one is left with Hugh Penn, Gareth&#8217;s birth father, who divorced Gareth&#8217;s mother when Gareth was but a boy, and with whom Gareth had a relationship that can only be described as . . . odd.<br />
<br />
In my own case, if I wasn&#8217;t exactly Gareth&#8217;s friend, I think it&#8217;s fair to say I was more than just a casual acquaintance:<br />
<br />
1, Gareth sent me pictures of himself and his wife at the time, which I still have.<br />
<br />
2, Gareth asked me to help him advertise <b>Times 17</b> through Mensa&#8217;s Special Interest Groups, which are called SIGs, and which are technically independent of Mensa (at the time, I was editor of two such groups, and knew many other editors), after the dictatorial Executive Director of American Mensa, the late Margot Seitelman, refused him access to any official publication (whether he paid for it or not).<br />
<br />
3, I called Gareth immediately after the publication of <b>Times 17</b> in 1987 to give him my critique of the book.  When I called again the next day, his wife answered the phone, and told me that Gareth had been in a good mood ever since talking to me.  He clearly took my opinion very seriously, and he kept writing to me in 1989 and 1990 even after he knew I suspected him, and had myself ceased writing to him.<br />
<br />
I was active in national Mensa politics, having run for First Vice-Chairman of The American Mensa Committee in 1987, plus I went to lots of conventions (which are called Regional Gatherings in Mensa), so besides our mutual interest in the Zodiac case, we knew many of the same people.  Eventually, Gareth&#8217;s behavior, as witnessed by other members I knew in the group, became one of the reasons I began to suspect him.<br />
<br />
I will detail my personal interaction with Gareth when I get to it chronologically.  Gareth claims to have made his radian discovery in late 1980, and I would not talk to him until the summer of 1985, so for the moment I&#8217;ll keep myself out of the narrative. <br />
<br />
What&#8217;s important for the reader to realize here is that there are TWO Gareth Penns.<br />
<br />
There&#8217;s the REAL Gareth Penn.<br />
<br />
And then there&#8217;s the Gareth Penn as he presents himself in <b>Times 17</b>.<br />
<br />
Remember what I said earlier about comic book superheroes being similar to serial killers, because both have secret identities?<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ll cite some examples off the top of my head (the reader may note that I&#8217;m a <b>DC Comics</b>, not a <b>Marvel Comics</b>, person):<br />
<br />
<b><u>Comic Book Superheroes</u><br />
Superman had Clark Kent.<br />
Batman had Bruce Wayne.<br />
Green Lantern had Hal Jordan.<br />
The Flash had Barry Allen.<br />
Wonder Woman had Diana Prince.<br />
Green Arrow had Oliver Queen.<br />
The Atom had Ray Palmer.</b><br />
<br />
<b><u>Serial Killers</u><br />
The Unabomber had Ted Kaczynski<br />
The Yorkshire Ripper had Peter Sutcliffe.<br />
Son of Sam had David Berkowitz.<br />
Seattle Ted had Ted Bundy.<br />
The Green River Killer had Gary Ridgway.<br />
The BTK Killer had Denis Rader.<br />
The Hillside Strangler had Ken Bianchi and Angelo Buono.</b><br />
<br />
The Zodiac Project had Michael O&#8217;Hare, Berta Margoulies, and Hugh Penn, but the franchise also had a spin-off character named Gareth Penn.  Where other serial killers had flirted with being their own publicity agents (Son of Sam and The BTK Killer), and in at least one instance, the p. r. man was completely independent of the killer (The Yorkshire Ripper and Wearside Jack), The Zodiac Project is unique in having a DESIGNATED publicity agent who posed as an independent investigator. <br />
<br />
It&#8217;s important to realize that <b>Times 17</b> isn&#8217;t a true life account of what Gareth Penn did after he discovered The Mt. Diablo Radian.  Gareth helped plan the Zodiac events, so he already KNEW about The Mt. Diablo Radian.  His account of the discovery and some of the subsequent events is purely fictitious, but some of what he reports actually happened.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s not as if Gareth Penn didn&#8217;t have encounters with Ken Narlow and Bob Graysmith and Ray Grant during his journey toward the truth.  He already knew what the truth was.  The only suspense was in whether he could con investigators, both professional and amateur, into following up on his theories, without them suspecting his own involvement.<br />
<br />
Why would a conspirator in a serial murder case implicate his fellow conspirators? <br />
<br />
The Zodiac Project is, first and foremost, a puzzle, and there would be no point in constructing such an elaborate maze if no one other than the conspirators ever traveled down its dark corridors with a flashlight (perhaps one taped to a gun barrel).<br />
<br />
The only way to get people into your maze is to show them the entrance to it. <br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<font style="font-size: 24px;">The Date</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
Let&#8217;s begin with the date itself.<br />
</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
In his book <b>Times 17</b>, Gareth Penn recounts making a momentous discovery on Friday evening, December 26, 1980 (page 24).  His discovery will come to be known, in Zodiac killer circles, as The Mt. Diablo Radian.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><img alt=""  src="images/4e8d639f23ba6166c2afba1578735a7b.png"  />&nbsp;</font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
Oddly enough, the radian discovery is the only event in Gareth&#8217;s book, other than his recounting of the crimes themselves, in which he&#8217;s specific about the date.  Even when he makes the connection to Michael O&#8217;Hare, on a trip to the Napa City and County Library (page 31), he doesn&#8217;t specify the date when the discovery takes place, or even mention the directory he found it in.  Which is good, since no directory at that library contains any such information.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/6e2f6dc7c809e6eab2e20b44e2d86f18.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
</font><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
The beginning of the Zodiac&#8217;s public activity, at least in The SF Bay Area, is The Lake Herman Road murders on Friday evening, December 20, 1968.<br />
<br />
The entry of Gareth Penn into the Zodiac case occurs with his discovery of The Mt. Diablo Radian on Friday evening, December 26, 1980.<br />
<br />
<b>Friday evening, December 20, 1968 = 12-20-68 = 122068<br />
<br />
Friday evening, December 26, 1980 = 12-26-80 = 122680<br />
<br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" width="689" height="461"  src="images/e9314e934af21c015b106990c2a8e214_t6nl.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
When confronted by that pesky Ray Grant and his preoccupation with phone numbers, Gareth Penn has shouted from the rooftops that his own number in 1983 . . .<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<b>(415) 499-0670</b></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
. . . just happens, purely by chance you understand, in its last five digits, to contain the date of Donna Lass&#8217;s disappearance from Stateline/South Lake Tahoe.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<b>90670 = September 6, 1970</b></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
If that&#8217;s just a coincidence, is this also just a coincidence?<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<b>122068</b></font><b><br />
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
122680</font></b><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
The only difference between those two number sequences is the placement of the zero.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Times 17</font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
Those readers familiar with my approach to examining conventional evidence know that I like to start at the very beginning of a time sequence, and move forward taking the smallest steps possible, downshifting to the lowest gear on the time machine.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m going to do that here with <b>Times 17</b>; I&#8217;ll start with the very first thing that happens, not in Gareth&#8217;s narrative but chronologically, and move forward one moment at a time.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/7491d6630c2f73842aa0a1b7d0b91435.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
The first two-and-a-half pages of Gareth&#8217;s book recount the Zodiac events in California, from Riverside to Presidio Heights:<br />
<br />
<b>During the period October 1966 through October 1969 . . . </b><br />
<br />
The first event involving any action by Gareth Penn himself occurs about halfway down page 3.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/3d99db646bfe58427f8ac5c539bf40b6.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
And it&#8217;s NOT his discovery of The Mt. Diablo Radian, but his account of a conversation between himself and his father, Hugh Penn:</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
<b>In December 1980, I learned of the contents of the Mount Diablo Letter by word of mouth from my father, Hugh Penn, who had read it while working at the Attorney General's Office in Sacramento.  He mentioned it to me and suggested that it seemed rather incongruous for someone who had been passed off as a moron by the police even to know what a radian is, let alone use the word in a sentence.  I had to agree.     </b><br />
<br />
First, note how odd that wording is:<br />
<br />
<b>I learned of the contents of the Mount Diablo Letter by word of mouth from my father, Hugh Penn</b><br />
<br />
Gareth emphasizes that the message was conveyed by word of mouth, instead of just saying that his father told him about the letter.  I believe Gareth does this to separate himself from the version of the letter that his father appears to be putting forth.  In other words, Gareth is giving himself Deniability, just in case he&#8217;s challenged about the contents of a page that, as far as anyone can tell, doesn&#8217;t even exist.<br />
<br />
Jake Wark commented on this on Tom Voigt&#8217;s original archived message board:<br />
<br />
<b>Penn claims that the passage quoted above was distilled through his father's memory -- Penn <i>pere</i> was a statistician with the CA Atty General's Office, and had looked at several letters but apparently never made copies. My guess is that Penn <i>fils</i> got the Mikado letter and the Mt. Diablo letter mixed up, since the Mikado letter mentioned the radians and the Mt. Diablo map wasn't published until the 1990s.</b><br />
<br />
Well, maybe.  But if this was the case, how did Hugh Penn gain access to a page from a Zodiac letter that wasn&#8217;t available to the public?<br />
<br />
Hugh Penn was an administrator/investigator working at the Attorney General's office in Sacramento, an agency which did not itself have an ongoing Zodiac investigation . . . yet he was somehow able to read a copy of the Zodiac letter whose second page of text, if it exists, has never been published.<br />
<br />
[The Zodiac] <b>suggested that "something interesting" would be found if the authorities were to place a radian on Mount Diablo, a prominent Bay Area landmark.</b><br />
<br />
Gareth Penn mentions demonstrating the radian for Ken Narlow on page 26.<br />
<br />
<b>He responded that he had been wondering for the last ten years what a radian was.</b><br />
<br />
This account might make more sense if Ken Narlow had been one of a handful of police officers who had gotten a look at the letter.  However, if Hugh Penn, an administrator with the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, had seen it, then it's clear the letter was looked at by a lot of law enforcement people, many of whom, like Hugh Penn, had college degrees.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/4c46b3ac3bc8643bf5a54491ef57af95_t9t9.jpg"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
Keep in mind that, when the authorities received The Lake Tahoe Card, police agencies dug numerous holes in the ground in the vicinity of Forest Pines, trying to match the placement of the punched hole in the card itself, looking for the burial spot of Donna Lass.  So how likely is it that, if there WAS a second page of text in The Mt. Diablo Letter, which said that &#8220;something interesting&#8221; would be found if the authorities were to place a radian on Mt. Diablo, that no one would think to try out that exercise for more than a decade after it was received?<br />
<br />
The answer is: No one thought to try out the exercise because the letter DIDN&#8217;T say that.<br />
<br />
The hint WAS given at the end of The Mikado Letter, but it was sufficiently removed from the contents of The Mt. Diablo Letter that trying out the exercise didn&#8217;t occur to anyone.  And even if that second page of text DID exist, and everyone missed the significance of the suggestion the first time out, would Zodiac hobbyists still deny the validity of the radian exercise if the Zodiac HAD said that &#8220;something interesting&#8221; would be found if authorities placed a radian on Mt. Diablo?&nbsp; I doubt it. <br />
<br />
If the second page of the letter said that, it hasn&#8217;t come to light in the four decades since.  In point of fact, nothing in The Mt. Diablo Letter itself suggests the exercise Gareth proceeds with that Friday evening.  To the contrary, the single page of text as it&#8217;s been presented to us over the past 40+ years seems quite self-contained:  <br />

<br />
Am I being too literal here?<br />
<br />
Those readers who have followed the career of Gareth Penn have noted his obsessive-compulsive insistence on linguistic precision.  Here's a snippet from a post on his blog about me:<br />
<br />
<b>I do not deny knowing Ray Grant. I was asked, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you ever sue your friend Ray?&#8221;, and I responded, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a friend named Ray, nor do I know anyone, even casually, with that name. The last Ray I can remember having known&#8230;&#8221; (see above). You will note that I was not asked if I knew Ray Grant; I was asked why I wasn&#8217;t suing my &#8220;friend Ray [no surname]&#8221; It&#8217;s important, when you hold someone responsible for something he has said, that you quote what he actually said and not something that you have fabricated. I do not, in fact, have a friend named Ray, I do not currently know anyone with that name, and until you jogged my memory, I did not recall Ray Grant (you will note that I did not categorically deny ever having known anyone named &#8220;Ray&#8221; other than the ones I cited; I wrote &#8220;The last Ray I can remember&#8221;).</b><br />
<br />
I&#8217;ll discuss Gareth&#8217;s opinion of me at a later date.  In the meantime, note that Mr. Penn is an absolute stickler for literalism.  When it comes to What Was Said, What Wasn&#8217;t Said, and all the inferences, implications, and nuances between those two antipodes, Gareth Penn is second-to-none as a semantic hair-splitter.<br />
<br />
This, then, seems odd in light of the casual approach Gareth Penn took to the source of the single most important piece of information he ever received.  If, for example, you&#8217;re a reasonably intelligent person, and someone tells you that you just won the Powerball lottery, the first thing you&#8217;re going to do is check your ticket and make sure your numbers match what&#8217;s been posted.<br />
<br />
But Gareth is clearly so caught up in trying out the radian exercise that he doesn&#8217;t bother to ask his dad any specifics about the part of the letter where the exercise is suggested.<br />
<br />
<b>I bought a sheet of clear acetate and a marking pen.  Using a protractor and a straightedge, I drew an angle between 57 and 58 degrees on the acetate and then laid the acetate over a map of the Bay Area.</b><br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/c1d2abd49454494c4dcf2983c4b76f93.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
Again, someone who insists on precision in others is uncharacteristically vague in his wording here.  WHAT map of the Bay Area is he talking about?  He can&#8217;t mean the Phillips 66 map page that came with The Mt. Diablo Letter, since Blue Rock Springs is NOT featured on that map.&nbsp; As the reader himself can see, Gareth's 'X' for the Blue Rock Springs Park crime scene would be above the top margin of the map page the Zodiac sent with The Mt. Diablo Letter. <br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/113daf87de5898aae564c9bee979277e_8sn3.gif"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
If, on the other hand, by "a map of the Bay Area", he&#8217;s talking about a USGS quadrangle (7.5 minutes squared), or even an entire 1&#176; squared section, since <b>Times 17</b> is loaded with geodetic references, no Geological Survey map features both VABM 3849 (Mt. Diablo) AND the points in Vallejo and Presidio Heights.  You might find all three on a standard service station map, or on a much larger scale topographic map, but not with enough detail to determine the placements of the murder scenes with the precision required of the exercise.     <br />
<br />
<b>I placed the apex of the angle on Mount Diablo, then rotated the angle around until one leg passed through the scene of the murder at Blue Rock Springs.  Then I felt as if a ton of bricks had fallen on me.  The other leg of the angle went straight through Presidio Heights in San Francisco where the Zodiac had murdered the cabby.  It was the most shocking experience of my entire life.</b><br />
<br />
The shock therapy of this experience actually changed Gareth into another person.<br />
<br />
Here&#8217;s the citation from Gareth Penn&#8217;s Wikipedia entry:<br />
<br />
<b>Penn graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) in Germanic languages and again in 1965 with an Master of Arts (MA) in Medieval Germanic languages. He received a Master of Library Science (MLS) from U.C. Berkeley in 1971.</b><br />
<br />
Gareth received a Master of Library Science from U. C. Berkeley in 1971.  If you have an advanced degree in library science, and you&#8217;re citing the single most important fact you&#8217;ve ever encountered in a self-published book (which means you have total control over how you present your material), how precise are you going to be about the source of that information?<br />
<br />
Remember, Gareth isn&#8217;t reporting what happened to him in real time. His radian exercise took place in late 1980, and his book was written in the spring of 1987.  He had more than a half-dozen years to double-check and triple-check his sources.&nbsp; Plus, since he&#8217;d been recounting those very events to various investigators and reporters during that span, he figured to have lots of practice explaining himself.<br />
<br />
No such reference to &#8220;something interesting&#8221; exists in the original letter, and Gareth never addresses the subject again.<br />
<br />
[The Zodiac] <b>suggested that "something interesting" would be found if the authorities were to place a radian on Mount Diablo, a prominent Bay Area landmark . . . the solution of the cipher would give the location of a "buried bomb" and that it would be necessary to go "four inches along the radian" to find it.</b><br />
<br />
Gareth&#8217;s version of events following his discovery of the radian is interrupted by various verbal excursions into the history of language and the methodology of communicating with extraterrestrial civilizations.  He begins his tale of radian discovery on page 3 of his book, and after numerous side trips, resumes the narrative on page 24.<br />
<br />
<b>When I discovered the secret of the radian on the evening of December 26, 1980, I was profoundly affected by it.  I had discovered something which was known to only one other person in the world, someone who had viciously attacked eight people, killing six of them.</b><br />
<br />
Note once again how Gareth dwells on the date.  He wants us to remember the exact date on which he made the radian discovery.&nbsp; This may seem natural to a reader unfamiliar with the book, but one will page through <b>Times 17</b> in vain looking for dates applied to other events, including Gareth's making the connection to Michael O&#8217;Hare. <br />
<br />
<b>Speaking of the police, I had to call them.</b><br />
<br />
If your father had been a police administrator, and was also the source of the information that led to your momentous discovery, wouldn&#8217;t he be the first person you called?<br />
<br />
<b>I could relieve myself of my dirty feeling only by having someone in authority take over the knowledge, which I could feel bearing down on me like a heavy burden.</b><br />
<br />
Gareth Penn was born on January 1, 1941.  If you take him at his word, he made the radian discovery on December 26, 1980, six days short of his 40th birthday.  He had three degrees from Cal-Berkeley and had served in the army, and if he wasn&#8217;t the most sociable person you were likely to meet, he was certainly no one&#8217;s fool.<br />
<br />
And yet, in the immediate aftermath of his radian discovery, he turns into Dagwood Bumstead.<br />
<br />
<b>I got the number of San Francisco Police Department from directory assistance.</b><br />
<br />
Gareth Penn, the information specialist with the advanced degree, calls Information.<br />
<br />
<b>I dialed the number around nine in the evening.  I got a desk sergeant.  I told him I had some important new information about the Zodiac murderer.  He asked me if he could take the information over the phone.  I was still slightly out of my body at the moment and was able to see myself as I looked at the map, then looked at the phone, double-taking over the problem of making him see a picture on a map over the wire.  I realized how ludicrous the situation was and made a mental note to laugh about it after I had hung up.  I thanked him and said that I would call back another time.</b><br />
<br />
The logical thing for someone of Gareth's intelligence to do, assuming that SFPD was the first call he'd make, would be to ask for the Homicide Detail.&nbsp; Instead, he acts as if he's reporting a street crime.<br />
<br />
<b>It was the most shocking experience of my entire life.<br />
</b>
<br />
The very first person I would have told would have been my father, since he was the source of the information, and especially since, having been an investigator and administrator for police and prosecutorial agencies, he would likely know the best way to proceed with this information.<br />
<br />
My next move would have been to arrange to look at the letter myself, if possible.  Since, by Gareth&#8217;s own admission, the information came by word of mouth, it&#8217;s possible that something was lost in the translation between what was on the page of the Zodiac&#8217;s letter and what his father had related.<b></b><br />
<br />
It&#8217;s unlikely that Hugh Penn saw a copy of the letter because he was visiting one of the police agencies involved in the case, since the first thing those investigators would have asked him is, Who wants to know?  Penn, Sr.&#8217;s job with the Attorney General&#8217;s Office would not have included anything about the Zodiac, and couldn&#8217;t, since he worked for a prosecutor&#8217;s office and the Zodiac hadn&#8217;t been identified or arrested yet.<br />
<br />
So the most likely explanation for Hugh Penn seeing a copy of the letter was that a copy of the letter was sent to the specific office where he was working, and he was able to get a look at it.  If that&#8217;s the case, it should not have been difficult for Gareth himself to get a look at the letter, or at least to have his father confirm what he reported seeing in the letter.<br />
<br />
The next logical thing for Gareth to do would be to actually go to the Attorney General&#8217;s Office and to demonstrate the radian exercise for the officials there.  If people in the office were impressed by the information, Gareth&#8217;s own word would have carried a lot more weight with the Department of Justice behind it.<br />
<br />
Instead, Gareth experiences amnesia about where the radian clue came from.  <br />
<br />
<b>All day Saturday, I was in a stew.  I was fairly exploding with the news and had nobody to explode on.</b><br />
<br />
Except his dad, of course.  Hugh Penn, who had a college degree and had been a cryptographer during his time in the Army during World War II, figured to be the most intelligent person associated with police agencies that Gareth could break the news to.&nbsp; But Gareth, for some reason, wants to disassociate Hugh Penn from what&#8217;s going on.  I wonder why?<br />
<br />
<b>Finally, Sunday morning, I called the San Francisco Chronicle.</b><br />
<br />
If your father had a career in law enforcement, and you had what you thought was significant information about a high profile case, wouldn&#8217;t your reflex be to contact the police first?  Wouldn&#8217;t contacting a big city newspaper tend to make it look as if you were just seeking publicity?  In other words, wouldn&#8217;t calling the newspaper at that stage be counterproductive? <br />
<br />
<b>Monday morning, I showed up at the Hall of Justice in Napa.</b><br />
<br />
If Gareth were not going to take his discovery to the Attorney General&#8217;s Office, the next most-likely place to go would have been SFPD, a big city police agency.  Instead, he visits the Napa Sheriff&#8217;s Office, which is sufficiently backward technologically that David Fincher&#8217;s movie <b>Zodiac</b> has the Bill Armstrong character offering to fax what information SFPD has, and Ken Narlow telling him that they don&#8217;t have a fax machine.  <br />
<br />
<b>We talked about the Zodiac for about three hours . . .</b><br />
<br />
He chooses Napa instead of SFPD because a smaller agency figures to be less sophisticated, and his own comfort level will be higher.  As the FBI has pointed out in their profiling, serial killers tend to strike first in familiar territory, where they feel the most comfortable.  This would also apply to a publicity agent for a serial killer who has to weather the storm of suspicion he will face when he first comes forward.<br />
<br />
Remember: Gareth SAYS he called SFPD first that Friday night, but we have no way of knowing that for sure.&nbsp; That's the advantage of talking to a desk sergeant instead of the Homicide Detail; there'd be no follow-up on the call, assuming he made it in the first place.<br />
<br />
The following Friday morning, Gareth talked to Ken Narlow again, this time in the presence of several other Zodiac investigators.  When it became clear that Gareth himself was under suspicion, he did his best to talk his way out of it.<br />
<br />
<b>I became a Zodiac suspect because I had shown up in Ken Narlow&#8217;s office in possession of knowledge which I wasn&#8217;t supposed to have.  Not only did I know about the radian hint, which I adequately explained by reference to my father&#8217;s part in it . . .</b><br />
<br />
In other words, Gareth had talked about the Zodiac with Ken Narlow for three hours the previous Monday, and the topic of his father, Hugh Penn, who worked for both the California Highway Patrol and the Attorney General's Office, and who was the source of his information, never came up.  Does this make sense to anyone? It only makes sense if you assume Gareth WANTED to be a suspect, and wanted Ken Narlow to go through the motions of clearing him so he would subsequently be free to disseminate his information without further suspicion.<br />
<br />
I can hear the reader muttering to himself, &#8220;Well, Gareth couldn&#8217;t expect his dad to divulge specific information about a letter that hadn&#8217;t been released to the public.&#8221;<br />
<br />
Maybe not.  But Gareth&#8217;s dad DID divulge something a lot more sensitive: the actual symbols of The Cryptogram as they were sent by the killer.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/e6fca07bec11d4c8a08418194e0552c6_6rnn.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
Granted, Gareth never mentions where he got the symbols (another example of disconnect), but I&#8217;m assuming he didn&#8217;t get them from Ken Narlow.  The only employee of a police (actually prosecutorial) agency likely to give him that information was Hugh Penn.<br />
<br />
I say the same thing about Gareth Penn that I&#8217;ve been saying about Michael O&#8217;Hare: at what point does his behavior become so bizarre that a Zodiac hobbyist begins questioning it?<br />
<br />
In the early 1990s, I asked Captain Roy Conway of Vallejo PD point-blank if The Mt. Diablo Letter included a second page with the suggestion Gareth mentions.  His answer, after a moment's pause, was Yes, which is why I quoted Gareth&#8217;s version of the letter in my books . . . but I now suspect Roy Conway misunderstood my question.  He may have thought I meant the Phillips 66 map page.<br />
<br />
SFPD has passed around those letters for decades.  Some of them have found their way to the homes of police administrators.  Is it conceivable that a single page from a letter sent in June 1970 would still be kept secret when everything else has been made public?<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/f9330f9c72bb9e5a3a431ba1b9c50416_cykf.gif"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
If SFPD really took the radian angle seriously, and had kept Page 2 secret for that reason, would they have released the last page of The Mikado Letter?  If police agencies really took the radian angle seriously, wouldn't they have immediately ushered Gareth Penn into an interrogation room as soon as he walked in, instead of giving him the bum's rush out the door?<br />
<br />
It's 2012, and a single page from a Zodiac letter hasn't been published, but the contents of that page have been made public, something the police would have known about since late 1980.  Police would also have known who the leak was--Hugh Penn.  Hugh Penn was also presumably the source for the original version of The Cryptogram to be found in <b>Times 17</b>, presented here with the deviations from the versions published in the newspapers:<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/424df893ea02522c25331fd644f825e8_joeg.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
One would think that, if police agencies were going to object to the publication of anything, they'd have objected to the original version of The Cryptogram being published.  After all, we have no way of knowing how seriously they took the radian clue, except for Ken Narlow's poker-faced reaction to it when Gareth Penn showed it to him.  But we know the police took The Cryptogram seriously, since they went to the trouble of even checking out Donald Harden when he came forward with a solution to the revised Cryptogram.<br />
<br />
It's possible that an unpublished page from a Zodiac letter has somehow slipped through the cracks, but it seems more likely that, in 1980, Gareth Penn and his cohorts decided that merely citing the PS in a follow-up letter wasn't going to be convincing enough to the average person.  The hint about placing the radian had to be there in the same letter with the Phillips 66 map and code, and the hint had to actually suggest placing a radian on Mt. Diablo instead of just saying that the code itself concerns radians.<br />
<br />
He must have decided that the radian PS was too far removed from The Mt. Diablo Letter for readers to make the connection, so he fabricated the part about &#8220;something interesting&#8221; in a second page, covering himself by filtering the information through his father.<br />

<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
Gareth mentions becoming a Zodiac suspect because he showed up in possession of knowledge he wasn&#8217;t supposed to have.<br />
<br />
If you look at the two most important insights he makes in <b>Times 17</b>, both are based on information he couldn't have gotten, since it doesn't exist.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>1. Police would find &#8220;something interesting&#8221; if they placed a radian on Mt. Diablo.<br />
<br />
</b><font style="font-size: 16px;">There is no second page of text in The Mt. Diablo Letter.</font><b><br />
<br />
<br />
2. A directory at the Napa City and County Library names Michael O&#8217;Hare.</b>
<br />
<br />
There is no directory at that library that mentions Michael O&#8217;Hare.<br />
<br />
<br />
Let&#8217;s look at page 31 of <b>Times 17</b>:<br />

<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
<b>I went to the Napa City and County Library and consulted their reference section for biographical dictionaries of artists.</b><br />
<br />
Note the disconnect: Gareth had worked for seven years as a reference librarian (so says the first sentence on the page), but he never cites a specific biographical dictionary.<br />
<br />
<b>I went through the H&#8217;s first . . . then I tried the Irish names in O&#8217;H-.</b><br />
<br />
Maybe he means he was checking ALL the biographical dictionaries there.  If so, he never tells us which SPECIFIC dictionary he finds the Berta Margoulies reference in.<br />
<br />
Professional academics and degreed librarians normally cite books by giving a title, author, year of publication, and publishing house.<br />
<br />
Note that Gareth doesn't even supply a title.<br />
<br />
He was either out to lunch at the most critical moment in his book . . . or he's smirking at us.<br />

<font style="font-size: 24px;">The Atlas Peak Fire</font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
On page 48 of <b>Times 17</b>, Gareth Penn finally mentions another specific date when an event in his book takes place.&nbsp; On June 22, 1981, an unknown arsonist started a massive forest fire in Napa, California, an event that became known as The Atlas Peak Fire.<br />
<br />
Note Gareth's detailed description of the fire itself:<br />
<br />
<b>Some time later, it came out in the newspaper stories that the fire of 22 June 1981, which destroyed sixty homes and blackened some 25,000 acres of forest and chaparral, was started by an unknown arsonist who planted a string of bombs alongside the access road to Rector Reservoir.&nbsp; There were nine bombs, all containing timers.&nbsp; The timers had been set to go off at 1:30pm.&nbsp; I didn't know yet about the Bus Bomb Diagram; I was not even to lay eyes on it until nine months later.&nbsp; But I knew who had set the fire anyway.</b><br />
<br />
In this particular case, I have an edge on every other Zodiac researcher; as far as I know, I'm the only one who discussed The Atlas Peak Fire with the official state investigator, Darrell Bressler, in 1990.<br />
<br />
<b>For many Napa Valley residents the massive out-of-control wildland fire
brings back memories of the June 1981 Atlas Peak fire, which blackened
23,000 acres and destroyed about 60 homes, Streblow said. Although there
were several injuries, no lives were lost in that fire.</b><br />
<br />
Mr. Bressler was surprised that I believed The Atlas Peak Fire was started by the Zodiac killer.&nbsp; What struck Bressler most about the blaze was the strategic way in which the fire was SET, taking into account the probable movements of the firefighters.&nbsp; Here's a passage from an online paper about that fire:<br />
<br />
<b><span style="font-family: trebuchet ms;">But the arsonist also had a
clever master plan. It seems that the Silverado Trail fires were
intended to lure the fire fighting resources away from the fires he was
yet to start in the areas of Soda Canyon and Atlas Peak, near Silverado
Country Club. Unfortunately, he was very successful with those fires.
The fires started on June 22nd, 1981 burned 23,600 acres and 65
structures. The fires blackened a path over 10 miles long - all the way
from the Silverado Country Club to the ridge above Pina Cellars.</span></b><br />
<br />
I originally read <b>Times 17</b> in 1987.&nbsp; I'm sure I was one of the book's first handful of readers.&nbsp; But I didn't talk to Darrell Bressler until 1990.&nbsp; So what Gareth said about how the blaze was started, I took at face value.<br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 16px;">[The fire]<b> was started by an unknown arsonist who
planted a string of bombs alongside the access road to Rector
Reservoir.&nbsp; There were nine bombs, all containing timers.&nbsp; The timers
had been set to go off at 1:30pm.&nbsp; I didn't know yet about the Bus Bomb
Diagram<br />
<br />
</b></font></font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/ac6c86c2fb5f3c7c26934f0a00874636.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
Gareth's version of events suggested that the same sort of device depicted in the Zodiac's Bus Bomb Diagram of November 9, 1969, or in The 13-Character Cipher Letter of April 20, 1970, perhaps in miniature, was used to ignite The Atlas Peak Fire.<br />
<br />
</font></font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/64c9bd883ad5ea2c9d92108e8841dd02.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
</font>
<br />
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">There's only one problem with his observation.&nbsp; As Darrell Bressler pointed out to me 22 years ago, The Atlas Peak Fire WASN'T started by a string of mechanical bombs containing timers.<br />
<br />
The Atlas Peak Fire was started by an arsonist or arsonists using a very simple device.<br />
<br />
Darrell was loath to describe the actual device used, for obvious reasons, but what he meant was something along the lines of a packet of matchbooks with a cigarette as the fuse.<br />
<br />
</font></font></font>
<div style="text-align: left;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><a href="http://community.discovery.com/eve/forums/a/tpc/f/5261919888/m/92119554201">Cigarette Fuse</a></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
So . . . where did Gareth get his information about mechanical bombs, when the head investigator for The Atlas Peak Fire says otherwise?&nbsp; I had several pages of illustrations for The Atlas Peak Fire in my physical book from 1990, one article from The New York Times, none of which mentioned mechanical bombs starting the fire.<br />
<br />
How could Gareth Penn--how could ANYONE--make a mistake of that magnitude?&nbsp; How could you suggest such a complex explanation for something when you cite no source for the information, and when the state investigator says there WERE no bombs?<br />
<br />
I know what Mike Butterfield's going to say about this.&nbsp; How DARE Ray Grant question Mike's former mentor Gareth Penn?<br />
<br />
Well, Mike, I'm just pointing out a pattern here:<br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 16px;">We're 48 pages into <b>Times 17</b>, and Gareth Penn has already dropped THREE bombshells:<br />
<br />
<br />
1. "Something interesting" would be found if a radian were placed on Mt. Diablo.<br />
<br />
2. Michael O'Hare's name was found in a biographical directory including his mother.<br />
<br />
3. Nine mechanical bombs containing timers ignited The Atlas Peak Fire.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
Those bombshells are breathtaking; but when you check the original sources, you find that:<br />
<br />
<br />
1. Gareth cites a 2nd page of text in The Mt. Diablo Letter, when there IS no 2nd page of text.<br />
<br />
2. Gareth cites a book at The Napa City &amp; County Library, when there IS no such book.<br />
<br />
3. Gareth cites bombs w/timers igniting The Atlas Peak Fire, when no such devices were found.<br />
<br />
<br />
So let me ask my pet question again:<br />
<br />
At what point does Gareth Penn's behavior (and Michael O'Hare's behavior, for that matter) become so BIZARRE that a Zodiac hobbyist will actually begin to question it?<br />
<br />
Here are some opinions along those lines, voiced a decade before Ray Grant went online: <br />
