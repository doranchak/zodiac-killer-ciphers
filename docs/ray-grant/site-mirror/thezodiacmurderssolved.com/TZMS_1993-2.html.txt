That is, again, the 1993 edition of TZMS I'm holding in this picture from 2010.
Harry Martin of The Napa Sentinel had a copy, which was eventually bought by
Bently and scanned onto Zodiac Zee circa late 2009. Mike Martin, who I gather
is no relation to Harry, ended up with that copy. I sent something like 20
copies to the faculty and administration of Cal-Berkeley in 1993.

I haven't heard back from them so far.

This webpage contains pages 234-482 of the book. Those of you who were around
for the first posting of this material a couple days ago saw the entire book on
one page before the program froze and then crashed. Even if the page had
survived, there were scrolling issues with 500 pages that aren't as severe with
the book divided in two. As I said, I may eventually post a commentary on this
edition when I have the time to reread it.
