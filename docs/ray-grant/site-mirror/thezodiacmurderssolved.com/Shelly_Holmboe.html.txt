Beginning with his mailing of The School Bus Threat Letter on October 13, and
then continuing with the murder of Shelly Holmboe on October 19, and finally
ending on October 22 with the much-dramatized (in the movie ZZooddiiaacc) appearance
of Melvin Belli on the Jim Dunbar TV show, Zodiac-related events shook the San
Francisco Bay Area for ten days in October 1969. I&#8217;m linking the three
events here (a mailing, a murder, and a phone call) because they are all
connected, one following from the next.

The School Bus Threat Letter was mailed two days after the Paul Stine murder.
It looks back on that murder, and forward with a new threat, apparently
directed against the children riding school buses, but actually predicting the
Zodiac killer's next (secret) murder.

The murder of Shelly Holmboe, though resembling other Zodiac murders and
containing some of the same cryptic indicators, has never been listed as an
&#8220;official&#8221; Zodiac murder.

The call to the Oakland Police Department was both an announcement of this
recent murder and a self-contained explanation for ALL his telephone calls,
hidden in an apparent request for publicity.

The three events are linked, not just chronologically, but thematically.

The letter and phone call are examples of the Zodiac killer using mass
media&#8212;the newspapers and television&#8212;to get his message out. Oddly
enough, it is the Zodiac killer coming closest to the Marshall McLuhan dictum--
oft-quoted in the 1960s--that The Medium Is The Message, but not in a way that
anyone receiving the information understood.

The two public events sandwich the death of a 1-year old infant, which was
apparently downplayed both because SFPD thought the killing had been done by
animals and to avoid subjecting the parents to the further pain and scrutiny
that an association with the Zodiac murders would bring.

What is clear, looking back on the three episodes, is that they predict the
expansion of the Zodiac murders into a cultural phenomenon, not just a news
cycle, and that it would be his intent to reach as large an audience as
possible.



Trip Book Entry

On October 13, 1969, the Zodiac killer mailed the first of two letters
ostensibly recapping the Paul Stine murder.

TThhiiss iiss tthhee ZZooddiiaacc ssppeeaakkiinngg

sshhiirrtt

Note that the Zodiac killer repeats the trip book notation, Washington & Maple,
instead of the actual murder corner (Washington & Cherry).

This is yet another &#8220;mistake&#8221; that calls attention to itself. He
makes this one to remind everyone that the original destination was Maple
Street, not Cherry Street.

Paul Stine survived the trip to Maple Street.

He didn&#8217;t survive Cherry Street because that was virgin territory.


Publicity

In October 1969, police in the San Francisco Bay Area began escorting school
buses wherever they went. There were numerous news segments on TV about it, all
in response to two sentences written by the Zodiac killer, a man they could
have arrested three nights earlier if they&#8217;d been paying attention.

SScchhooooll cchhiillddrreenn mmaakkee nniiccee ttaarrgg--

bboouunncciinngg oouutt..

The main purpose of the school bus threat is to keep the Zodiac killer on the
front pages of the newspapers. Once the Stine murder is done, he knows that his
time onstage&#8212;at least, as a killer&#8212;is over. So he has to threaten
something so horrible, the public will pay attention and keep paying attention
for a long time to come.

But there was another reason to make the threat, even though he never had any
intention of carrying it out.


Child Victims?

As the Zodiac killer will say in a subsequent letter (April 20, 1970):

PPSS II hhooppee yyoouu hhaavvee ffuunn ttrryyiinngg
ttoo ffiigggguurree oouutt wwhhoo II kkiilllleedd..

The disappearance of Donna Lass, who was murdered almost a year after The
School Bus Threat Letter, was convincingly Zodiac-like to engage several police
agencies in attempts to find her body, based on clues in Zodiac letters.

So clearly, authorities believed he might still be KILLING PEOPLE.

Incidentally, I will be discussing the burial location of Donna Lass when I
come to that crime.

But after the Stine murder, his killings became as cryptic as his ciphers.

Wouldn&#8217;t it make sense if, immediately following his final
&#8220;public&#8221; murder, the Zodiac killer gave a hint as to his next,
&#8220;secret&#8221; murder? So the second reason for making the school bus
threat, which appears out of the blue, is to anticipate that next murder. The
school bus threat is the last thing he does, immediately prior to murdering a
child.

Remember, the chief design aspect of the Zodiac murders is symmetry, so there
are always at least two reasons for everything he does. The school bus threat
is a wake-up call, but not in the sense the police think it is. It tells the
public the Zodiac killer is capable of committing murders that would ordinarily
be considered off limits even to serial killers.

Such as the premeditated murder of a one-year-old.


Shelly Holmboe 1

Shelly Holmboe, 1, disappeared from her home at 1709 Peony Lane in Los Gatos on
Sunday evening, October 19, 1969. Her body was found in a field near her house.
She had been stabbed and nearly decapitated in a manner similar to the killing
of Cheri Bates, who had also died on a Sunday. A man in his 20s was seen
running from the area where her body was found.



The killing defied any psychological profile that police were familiar with--
a child snatched and murdered immediately. The child had not been molested. Nor
was the crime an attempted kidnapping gone wrong, since the child had not been
discovered missing for some time. There was no outcry when she was abducted,
and therefore no reason for the kidnapper to panic.
It didn&#8217;t make sense.

In Robert Graysmith&#8217;s ZZooddiiaacc, on page 120 of the hardcover edition, he
mentions how the police were puzzled by the Zodiac&#8217;s sudden claim of
seven victims in the two November 1969 letters. Two San Jose teenagers were
killed in early August, but those murders would be attributed to another killer
within two years. Graysmith then notes that, &#8220; Toschi knew of no other
killings, with the exception of an infant that he suspected had been killed by
dogs.&#8221;

The infant Graysmith was talking about was Shelly Holmboe.

I&#8217;m not absolutely sure the Zodiac killed Shelly Holmboe.
I can&#8217;t be, because accounts of the death itself are sketchy.
But I think he did. And I believe subsequent events point back to it.

It&#8217;s a terrible crime, even for the Zodiac killer. Clearly, the school
bus threat is a hint, out of the blue and less than a week prior to the murder,
that he is capable of killing a child.

The Zodiac killer&#8217;s radian is apexed on Mt. Diablo at VABM 3849, which
among other things is the intersection of The Mt. Diablo Base Line and The Mt.
Diablo Meridian, which are found on USGS maps of the area.

Shelly Holmboe&#8217;s body was found either right beside or directly on The
Mt. Diablo Meridian.

The reader will object that the Zodiac killer always announces his murders.

But the Shelly Holmboe murder is the first of four &#8220;secret&#8221;
murders.

Nonetheless, he does actually announce the murder with the very next thing he
does.


Shelly Holmboe 2

Why would someone&#8212;why would ANYONE--kill a one-year old child?

Especially someone who&#8217;s doing it to create a public puzzle?

The Zodiac killer was interested in aspects of the identities of the victims.
But a one-year-old isn&#8217;t going to have much to offer. She&#8217;s got no
social security number, no public identity.

But we know Shelly Holmboe was a virgin.

We also know that her name contained the word EASTER.

I've talked about Michael O'Hare's preoccupation with dividing his life into
23/23.

Shelly Holmboe was 23 months old when she died.

And in the subsequent days and weeks following her death, her parents received
the same odd, harassing phone calls that relatives of other Zodiac victims
received, following their deaths.

That some of these calls were made by a woman might suggest, to some, that the
Zodiac killer wasn't involved, but since Berta Margoulies was the main planner
of The Zodiac Project, she could also have authored those female calls.

October 19, 1969 was also Hugh Penn's 56th birthday.


Shelly Holmboe 3

So why do it?

Why kill a little girl, just to make a point in a puzzle?

Because, from their vantage point, they had no choice.

The Zodiac Project is about art, language, history, literature . . . all
aspects of culture.

And it evokes one of the most horrifying memories in human history, the
practice of pagan sacrifice. If the reader rents TThhee WWiicckkeerr MMaann from Netflix,
particularly the original film with Edward Woodward and Britt Eklund, which is
about pagan practices in (then) present-day Britain, he will find that the
intended victim of the pending pagan sacrifice is a young girl.

A young girl was the typical pagan sacrifice, because girls were less
economically important than boys in pastoral society, and probably also because
the child mortality rate was high anyway.

That's why the concept of virginity is so critical (as it was to prospective
grooms in pagan society, since otherwise paternity would be in doubt).

In the Roman Terminus ritual, animals were sacrificed, but that couldn't be
enough for The Zodiac Project. To emphasize that they were sacrificing pre-
selected lives in ritual murder, as the Zodiac killer personified at Lake
Berryessa, wearing his ceremonial costume and stabbing the victims rather than
shooting them, at least one of his victims had to be an actual child.

The pagans who thus murdered children didn't do it joyfully; it had to be done
to appease the gods and assure a good harvest.

BATES HAD TO DIE, and Cheri was stabbed and nearly decapitated in a ritual
killing.

And Shelly Holmboe had to die, also stabbed and nearly decapitated in a ritual
manner.

She was an EASTER victim, a religious sacrifice. And a Zodiac killer victim.


OPD Phone Call 1

A phone call came in to the Oakland Police Department at 2am Wednesday, October
22, 1969.

TThhiiss iiss tthhee ZZooddiiaacc ssppeeaakkiinngg.. II wwaanntt yyoouu ttoo ggeett iinn ttoouucchh wwiitthh FF.. LLeeee BBaaiilleeyy.. IIff

The Oakland Police Department is an acrostic:

OOaakkllaanndd PPoolliiccee DDeeppaarrttmmeenntt
OO PP DD

OOPPDD

OPD is the British version of our DOA (Dead On Arrival).

OPD means Officially Pronounced Dead.

It is as if the Zodiac killer were announcing another murder!

The interval is similar to that between the Paul Stine murder and The School
Bus Threat Letter, 2-3 days. So the phone call could be an acknowledgment of
the Shelly Holmboe murder. Remember, he doesn&#8217;t need to acknowledge the
Stine murder a second time--he&#8217;s already done that with the letter of
October 13th that includes the piece of Stine&#8217;s shirt.

Phone Calls 1

Since the call to The Oakland Police Department was, as far as anyone knows,
the Zodiac killer&#8217;s last &#8220;official&#8221; phone call (though he may
also have called a radio station in Oklahoma City in December 1969), this might
be a good time to comment on his habit of making phone calls after he commits
his murders.

As we know, the Zodiac killer never does anything without a reason,
particularly if it&#8217;s something he does over and over. He&#8217;s usually
telling us something about himself: specifically, who he is.

So let&#8217;s recap:

1, He refers to a phone call made either to the police or to The Riverside
Enterprise in The Confession Letter:

YYEESS II DDIIDD MMAAKKEE TTHHAATT CCAALLLL TTOO YYOOUU AALLSSOO..

If he made one, Riverside PD hasn&#8217;t come forward about it.

2, He calls The Vallejo Sheriff&#8217;s Office after the shootings at Blue Rock
Springs.

3, Later that night, he calls members of the Ferrin family long before any
reports air on the TV or radio about the murder.

4, He calls Napa PD from the Napa Car Wash after the Lake Berryessa attacks.

5, Finally, on October 22, 1969, he calls Oakland PD and demands to talk either
to F. Lee Bailey or Melvin Belli. The subsequent Channel 7 caper is covered in
David Fincher&#8217;s ZZooddiiaacc.

I don&#8217;t think the Zodiac killer ever intended to call the Channel 7 talk
show.

By calling Oakland PD he was calling attention to the phone calls themselves.
He was demonstrating, as dramatically as he possibly could, that his phone
calls had come to an end, that it was time to figure out their real intent.
It&#8217;s unfortunate, or perhaps even funny, that the phone calls to Belli
from the mental patient at Napa State Hospital ruined the intended effect,
which was to have the motor-mouthed Melvin sit waiting for a call that never
came.

He didn&#8217;t need to call them with information about himself; the act of
calling was itself packed with information.


Phone Calls 2

There was a great Ellery Queen TV show episode years ago, where a guy gets shot
while he&#8217;s trapped in a phone booth. He can&#8217;t get out, and he
doesn&#8217;t have a pen, but he picks the phone up and makes a call before he
drops dead.

Ellery thinks--He tried to call the cops! No.

Ellery thinks--He tried to call for help! Nope.

Ellery stops thinking; they have the call traced.

It turns out he called a tailor in Brooklyn!
Someone the victim didn&#8217;t even know.

Then it dawns on Ellery: The victim dialed his killer&#8217;s name, using the
letters on the phone dial.

The Zodiac killer did something almost identical to that, except to identify
himself. And we have to keep in mind--he was using a 1960s rotary dial, not the
push button panels we have today.

Let&#8217;s dial in the name ZODIAC on a phone dial and see what we get!

ZZ OO DD II AA CC
---- 66 33 44 22 22

Significant? Definitely, if, like pi in binary, we read it backward.

But first, let&#8217;s keep in mind that 6 is Morse/binary ME:

MM EE
1111 00 == 66 (Morse code/binary math)

So, reading the statement backward, we get:

CC AA II DD OO ZZ
22 22 44 33 66 ----

22224433 == 66

22224433 ((iiss)) MMEE

What does that mean?

Let me suggest once again that 2243 is a date . . . of birth.

22224433 == JJaannuuaarryy 2222,, 11994433

I. e., the 22nd day of &#8217;43.

And whose birthday might that be?


Dante's Inferno 67:31

Incidentally, I haven&#8217;t mentioned DDaannttee&&##88221177;;ss IInnffeerrnnoo in a while now,
but there&#8217;s an interesting equation you can create with some chapter and
verse.

In Canto 31, we reach the Ninth Circle of Hell, and meet Nimrod, who is mired
there for attempting to storm Heaven. Part of his punishment, since he created
the Tower of Babel, is to speak a language that no one understands. Prompted by
the poet&#8217;s appearance in his lowly domain, Nimrod speaks one line of
gibberish (kind of like the last 18 letters of The Cryptogram, or The 340-
Character Cipher) that is untranslatable:

RRaapphheell mmaaii aammeecchh zzaammii aallmmii

That&#8217;s line 67 of Canto 31.
Of all the lines in DDaannttee&&##88221177;;ss IInnffeerrnnoo, this one is closest to being a
cipher!

I find it interesting that, if you divide the number suggested by that line by
three--the number of heads the devil has and the number of parts The Cryptogram
was divided into--you get the two halves of Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s
identity, separated by a decimal point.

In other words: another crossroads, like the one in Riverside:

66773311 // 33 == 22224433..666666

22224433..666666

&#8216;2243&#8217; is, again, a way of saying January 22, 1943.

&#8216;666&#8217; the reader can probably translate for himself.


October 1969 Review

The mailing of The School Bus Threat Letter, the murder of Shelly Holmboe, and
the call to The Oakland Police Department span a ten-day period in October
1969. This review will focus on ten points, one for each day:

November December 1969

The Pen Card itself is a metaphor for the Zodiac killer's secret writing.

SSOORRRRYY II HHAAVVEENN''TT WWRRIITTTTEENNmeans, in effect,SSOORRRRYY II''MM NNOOTT SSPPEELLLLIINNGG TTHHIINNGGSS OOUUTT FFOORR
YYOOUU..

BBUUTT II JJUUSSTT WWAASSHHEEDD MMYY PPEENNmeans that he's cleaned his writing of any obvious
references to his identity, so people will have to find the ones that aren't so
obvious.

He can't do a THING with his pen; instead, he does his THING when he's
committing murders. His murders are the most visible THING in The SF Bay Area
in November 1969; his letters, on the other hand, are written in invisible ink.

The 340 is yet another example of orchestrating mystery. It's a long, drawn-out
joke that has a "Yeah, so?" punchline, just like The Cryptogram. It's not that
the Zodiac killer's ciphers don't contain significant information; they do. But
the joke is that EVERYTHING he does contains information. So he gets the police
and public to concentrate on the ciphers, and once they're distracted by things
that either make no sense (The Cryptogram) or are too dense to solve (The 340),
they're too discouraged to try to figure all the other stuff out.

Other than that, what the Zodiac killer is doing is pretty blatant. He's killed
7 people, and he's using alphabet substitution as his code. His disguise is
that he doesn't look like a typical killer. He looks entirely different, not
because of anything about his physical appearance, but because he doesn't fit a
preconception of the way a killer should look. If beauty is in the eye of the
beholder, looking suspicious is in the mind of society and its various police
agencies.

There's a funny New Yorker cartoon which shows several men standing in a room
during the time of the Revolutionary War. All of the men look like George
Washington, except one who looks like a weasel. A man comes to the door and
asks, "Which one of you is Benedict Arnold?"


Pen Card

The Pen Card of November 8, 1969, is the Zodiac killer&#8217;s first commercial
greeting card message, the first of three he will send (four, if you count The
Eureka Card of December 1990). On the cover is a dripping fountain pen with the
accompanying greeting:





The emphasis on &#8216;Thing&#8217; is just a reiteration of his alphabet
fixation:

TT HH II NN GG
2200 ++ 88 ++ 99 ++ 1144 ++ 77 == 5588

I. e., it&#8217;s the same as ZODIAC.

ZZ OO DD II AA CC
2266 ++ 1155 ++ 44 ++ 99 ++ 11 ++ 33 == 5588

Doing his &#8216;thing&#8217; means being the Zodiac.

The point of the reference is to confirm that he&#8217;s using alphabet
numbers.


Misdirection

Beneath the handwritten message inside The Pen Card, five &#8220;months&#8221;
were listed, which police and Robert Graysmith assumed meant the months in
which the killer claimed victims:


DDeess JJuullyy AAuugg
SSeepptt OOcctt == 77

At the time, everyone reading the card knew who the Zodiac killed in December
(Faraday and Jensen), July (Ferrin), September (Shepard), and October (Stine),
but what TWO victims did he kill in August, so that the victim count adds up to
7?

The answer is . . . he didn't kill ANYONE in August!

You&#8217;re only looking for two victims in August if you think the "months"
are there to represent when victims were killed. They're not!

Besides, readers of this book know that there were two additional victims in
October:

DDeecceemmbbeerr:: FFaarraaddaayy aanndd JJeennsseenn
JJuullyy:: FFeerrrriinn
SSeepptteemmbbeerr:: SShheeppaarrdd
OOccttoobbeerr:: BBaatteess,, SSttiinnee,, aanndd HHoollmmbbooee

NOW let's add up the victims:

BBaatteess ++ FFaarraaddaayy ++ JJeennsseenn ++ FFeerrrriinn ++ SShheeppaarrdd ++ SSttiinnee ++ HHoollmmbbooee == 77

The listed &#8216;months&#8217; are a prime example of the Zodiac
killer&#8217;s strategy, which is misdirection.

The cleverest sleight-of-hand artist is the one who keeps his hands in plain
view at all times, and yet fools us completely, because he gets our eyes to go
in the wrong direction while the real action takes place elsewhere.

Throughout the Zodiac coverage on TV, people like Robert Graysmith and the late
Paul Avery have pointed to the Zodiac killer&#8217;s &#8220;scoreboards&#8221;,
the lines at the bottom of some of his letters which indicate how many victims
he&#8217;s claiming, often presented as a &#8220;score&#8221; with The San
Francisco Police Department (&#8216;SFPD&#8217;) assigned the number zero.

The Zodiac killer seems to claim 7 victims (November 8, 1969), 10 (April 20,
1970), 12 (June 26, 1970), 13 (July 25, 1970), 17+ (March 13, 1971), and
finally 37 (January 29, 1974).

However, at no time does the Zodiac killer actually SAY that the numbers at the
bottom represent how many victims he&#8217;s killed.

The Zodiac killer only explicitly claims a specific number of victims in three
letters: 7 (November 9, 1969), 8 (December 20, 1969), and 10 (April 20, 1970).

The misdirection lies in the Zodiac killer's allowing us to believe that the
numbers are victim counts, when he is usually talking about something else.


Months

Let&#8217;s look at the &#8216;months&#8217; as they are written in The Pen
Card, and see if they might instead stand for something else.

DDeess JJuullyy AAuugg
SSeepptt OOcctt == 77

If you&#8217;ve been following my approach so far, you know that my knee-jerk
reaction to deciphering anything Zodiac is to assign alphabet values to
letters. So let&#8217;s do that!

DD EE SS JJ UU LL YY AA UU GG
44 ++ 55 ++ 1199 == 2288 1100 ++ 2211 ++ 1122 ++ 2255 == 6688 11 ++ 2211 ++ 77 == 2299


SS EE PP TT OO CC TT
1199 ++ 55 ++ 1166 ++ 2200 == 6600 1155 ++ 33 ++ 2200 == 3388

Now let&#8217;s add up the numbers!

DDEESS 2288
JJUULLYY 6688
AAUUGG 2299
SSEEPPTT 6600
_OO_CC_TT_ _++_33_88
222233

The Zodiac killer uses the abbreviated "months" to highlight one of the main
themes of his murder project (2-23)--but no one sees it because they&#8217;re
sure it means something else.

By the way, note the misspelling of the abbreviation for December. He
abbreviates December &#8216;DES&#8217; so that the letters will add up to 223.
This is the real reason his letters contain misspellings and bad grammar. Not
because he&#8217;s stupid--he&#8217;s anything but. But because these
&#8220;mistakes&#8221; allow him to form an undertext.


223 = 7

DDeess JJuullyy AAuugg
SSeepptt OOcctt == 77

DDEESS 2288
JJUULLYY 6688
AAUUGG 2299
SSEEPPTT 6600
_OO_CC_TT_ _++_33_88
222233

But wait, you say.
The equation he&#8217;s created doesn&#8217;t add up!

222233 == 77

Sure, it's seven victims, but 223 doesn't equal 7. That doesn&#8217;t make
sense, does it?

Sure it does. Remember the Zodiac killer&#8217;s fundamental principle of
symmetry.
Everything he says has to be right in at least two different ways.

222233 == 77

Add up the numerals on the left and see if they equal the one on the right.
