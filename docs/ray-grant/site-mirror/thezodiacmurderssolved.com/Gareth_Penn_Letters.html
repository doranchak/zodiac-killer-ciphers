<br />
Speaking of things that began 27 years ago, I will be presenting numerous Gareth Penn mailings from the 1980s.&nbsp; I will start with the letters Gareth addressed to me personally.&nbsp; Back in the 1980s, if you had an article you wanted your fans to read, you didn't have the recourse of posting it on a website, since there were no websites.&nbsp; Instead, you typed it up, had it photocopied, and then mailed it off in manila envelopes to everyone on your mailing list.<br />
<br />
For every letter Gareth addressed to me personally, there's at least one typed presentation of some point (usually cryptographic) he needed to make.&nbsp; Also keep in mind that Gareth and I were talking on the phone as often as we were sending letters back and forth; I don't have transcripts of those calls, but a few of them bear scrutiny in the light of later events.<br />
<br />
I will present the letters addressed to me first, and then do the handouts.&nbsp; Since this is new technology to me, I will probably be tweaking the presentation as I learn more about how to make it look better on the website.&nbsp; Also, let me stress that, because I've tried to make the site simpler for me to add things, I will probably be editing this chapter and adding things to it as I go, so don't assume you've seen everything if you've only clicked on it once.<br />
<br />
As I type these words, it is August 11, 2012, exactly 23 years after the date of the intended <i>denouement</i> of The Zodiac Project, The Terminus Event of August 11, 1989.<br />
<br />
Ironically, exactly TWO years ago, a poster on ZKF who calls himself ZSEARCHER, but whose real name is Tom DiMarco, came up with this comment on his own "Where's The Evidence" thread over there:<br />

<div class="content"><b>Farmer keeps on talking about how Penn and Grant were buddies so he should know the kind of person he is.</b><br />
<br />
<b>This
is Penn's take on the relationship from his blog:</b><br />
<br />
<i>I do not deny
knowing Ray Grant. I was asked, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you ever sue your friend
Ray?&#8221;, and I responded, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a friend named Ray, nor do I know
anyone, even casually, with that name. The last Ray I can remember
having known&#8230;&#8221; (see above). You will note that I was not asked if I knew
Ray Grant; I was asked why I wasn&#8217;t suing my &#8220;friend Ray [no surname]&#8221;
It&#8217;s important, when you hold someone responsible for something he has
said, that you quote what he actually said and not something that you
have fabricated. I do not, in fact, have a friend named Ray, I do not
currently know anyone with that name, and until you jogged my memory, I
did not recall Ray Grant (you will note that I did not categorically
deny ever having known anyone named &#8220;Ray&#8221; other than the ones I cited; I
wrote &#8220;The last Ray I can remember&#8221;). Ray Grant is just one of hundreds
of people with whom I corresponded a quarter century ago, most of whose
names I have not retained. I would not characterize him as a &#8220;friend.&#8221;
He presented to me a convoluted theory about the Zodiac&#8217;s use of
firearms, apparently seeking my endorsement. I didn&#8217;t agree with him and
told him so. He seemed to feel that he was entitled to my endorsement
and became very bitter and accusatory. I haven&#8217;t read anything he has
had to say since then and so have no idea what his current theories are.
I gather from what you say that he has spent the last quarter century
pouting. Now that he knows that I haven&#8217;t been paying attention to his
slandering of me, he will probably pout even more. I regret that you
feel that I am high-handed and supercilious, but I got the feeling that
he felt the same way about me simply because I didn&#8217;t buy his theory. I
don&#8217;t remember specifically, but I may have sent him those photos back
in the days before I turned him into an implacable foe by having the
temerity to disagree with him. Apparently, some people believe that
because all men are created equal, the same is true of all theories, and
I suspect that by not applying the principles of Jeffersonian democracy
to other people&#8217;s ideas, you run the risk of being called &#8220;high-handed&#8221;
and &#8220;supercilious.&#8221;</i><br />
<br />
<b>Hmmm, 25 years ago Grant got snubbed by Penn. Five years later according to Grant, Penn is the Zodiac.</b></div>
<br />
Going by that logic, 25 years ago Tom DiMarco must have walked up to the actor Peter O'Toole and asked for an autograph . . . and got snubbed.&nbsp; Now I know why DiMarco thinks Lawrence of Arabia is the Zodiac killer.<br />
<br />
As far as my being snubbed by Penn . . . didn't happen.&nbsp; And here are the letters to prove it.<br />
<br />
Let's look at a critical passage from Gareth's post above:<br />
<br />
<b><font style="font-size: 16px;"><i>He presented to me a convoluted theory about the Zodiac&#8217;s use of
firearms, apparently seeking my endorsement. I didn&#8217;t agree with him and
told him so. He seemed to feel that he was entitled to my endorsement
and became very bitter and accusatory.</i></font></b><br />
<br />
Gareth is talking here about page 5 from the December 14, 1986 letter below.&nbsp; The theory he is disagreeing with can be found elsewhere right on this website:<br />
<br />
<a href="Presidio_Heights.html">see: Gun Numbers 1-3</a><br />
<br />
I mentioned my theory to Gareth, he clearly disagreed with it in the letter, I wrote back answering his own points . . . and then we both dropped the subject.&nbsp; If I became very bitter and accusatory, you sure couldn't tell it from his own letters to me.&nbsp; And Gareth went on writing to me, quite cordially, until his last letter in May 1990.&nbsp; Gareth sent the last three letters of the correspondence and even sent me pictures of himself and his then-spouse, Diane Merrill, including their wedding photo at a Mensa event.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt="" width="688" height="511"  src="images/8545eb652e42587f7c77a17976dc360a.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
What I said to Tom DiMarco back then, I will say yet again:<br />
<br />
<b>If you knew more about the case, you'd have a different opinion.&nbsp; Trust me.<br />
</b><br />
Where was I?&nbsp; Oh, yes.&nbsp; Here are the letters Gareth sent to me, not including the hand-outs.&nbsp; I may post those as well in the near future.&nbsp; I'm including what looks like a hand-out that Gareth sent on May 22, 1990, because I may be the only one who received it.<br />
<br />
I posted these pages in the wee hours of Saturday morning.&nbsp; I was looking at the website late this evening (still Saturday) and noticed that most of the pages scan with a yellowish tint, presumably from the age of the paper, but some others scan as white.&nbsp; I'm not sure if this is because of some glitch in the scanner software or if those particular pages were copies of the originals.&nbsp; If the reader will go to my video from last October, Zodiac Killer Solved 13 . . . <br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRM7yRangO0">Zodiac Killer Solved 13</a><br />
<br />
&nbsp;. . . I hold up the box I've kept the letters in for the past quarter-century or so.&nbsp; I did notice, as I was going through the various papers in the box, that some I'd copied for one reason or another (mostly the handouts, but also some letters).&nbsp; When I did the scanning, I thought I'd used the originals when there was more than one copy, but I suppose it's possible some copies got mixed in with the originals.&nbsp; The reader will notice that most of the first pages of the letters feature the outline of a rusty paper clip that's been removed before scanning.&nbsp; In any case, these pages are what Gareth mailed to me for the most part, with a possibly copied page mixed in here and there.&nbsp; It occurs to me now that I may have copied some original pages to make them more readable when I was scanning them onto ZKS a couple years ago; the white pages look easier to read than the yellow ones.<br />
<br />
If the reader has any trouble reading what's scanned here, he can probably fix the problem by using the ZOOM function on his web browser to blow the page up a bit.&nbsp; <br />

<div style="text-align: left;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">I just found page 4 of this letter; I'm sure I still have the third page somewhere but haven't found it yet.&nbsp; In any case, page 4 is quite interesting since it includes information about Hugh Penn.<br />

<div style="text-align: left;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">As I said, I will be adding to this article in the very near future as I sift through other stuff Gareth sent me.&nbsp; In the meantime, I want the reader to notice something EXTREMELY ODD about that last page I scanned, just above.<br />
<br />
I cited three instances in the article <b>1980/1981</b> of Gareth citing facts that were blatantly untrue.<br />
<br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 16px;">1. Gareth cites a 2nd page of text in The Mt. Diablo Letter, when there IS no 2nd page of text.<br />
<br />
2. Gareth cites a book at The Napa City &amp; County Library, when there IS no such book.<br />
<br />
3. Gareth cites bombs w/timers igniting The Atlas Peak Fire, when no such devices were found.</font><br />
<br />
<br />
Now we have yet a 4th example of the well-educated, meticulous Gareth Penn with his degree in library science from Cal-Berkeley, citing a raw fact that is simply not true:<br />
<br />
<b>" . . . Benchmark 9, at The Greyhound bus terminal in downtown Boston, where Joan Webster's murderer left her suitcase . . ."</b><br />
<br />
It's true that Joan Webster's murderer left her suitcase in a storage locker at the bus terminal.<br />
<br />
But The Greyhound Bus Terminal doesn't contain USGS Benchmark 9.&nbsp; In fact, that building doesn't contain a USGS benchmark of any designation.&nbsp; The benchmark found at that location on that USGS quadrangle is, in fact, located at 175 Berkeley Street, the address of The Liberty Mutual Building.&nbsp; And the benchmark in that building was releveled in 1966, and is, in fact, Benchmark 3, NOT Benchmark 9 (though granted, the maps still say "BM9").&nbsp; Here is a copy of the USGS quadrangle "Boston South" with Gareth's annotations in red; BM9 is in the center:<br />
<br />
<img alt="" width="688" height="529"  src="images/444861e1b3e1a546ba21e5376581cd22.jpg"  /><br />
<br />
Now the reader is probably chuckling to himself about how the great Gareth Penn could make such an honest mistake.&nbsp; Except it's not an honest mistake.&nbsp; The only way you can locate a USGS Benchmark is to find a particular BM designation on a USGS map and then contact the USGS, at which point they will locate the data for that benchmark and read it to you over the phone and/or send it to you in the mail.<br />
<br />
<img alt=""  src="images/116bbc412686cf6220a36e8b9fbd65f6.jpg"  /><br />
<br />
Another way of saying this is, You just CAN'T misidentify a USGS benchmark, because the only way you can get information about one is to contact the USGS.<br />
<br />
And you certainly can't mistake it for a location that DOESN'T contain a benchmark.<br />
<br />
In other words, Gareth didn't misidentify that benchmark by mistake.<br />
<br />
He did it on purpose.<br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 16px;">So let me ask my pet question again:<br />
<br />
At what point does Gareth Penn's behavior (and Michael O'Hare's
behavior, for that matter) become so BIZARRE that a Zodiac hobbyist will
actually begin to question it?<br />
<br />
Oh, wait.&nbsp; I was sifting through the box of letters from my Secret Penn Pal, this time looking for his article/handouts, and I found another entire letter from December 23, 1986.&nbsp; What's particularly interesting about this letter is that it comes just 9 days after the alleged argument between Gareth and myself (December 14, 1986--see letter above) that supposedly resulted in my becoming Gareth's "implacable foe".<br />
<br />
I want Tom DiMarco to pay special attention to this missive/missile, since it pretty well nukes his theory that Gareth "snubbed" me, which then resulted in my accusation that Gareth is the Zodiac.&nbsp; Gareth IS the Zodiac, mind you, or one of the four, but I didn't come to that conclusion because I was bitter about his treatment of me.&nbsp; Note that Gareth is soliciting a special favor from me in the letter; that strikes me as being the opposite of a "snub".&nbsp; Also note that Gareth acknowledges the counter-arguments in my own letter and then immediately asks for my help, demonstrating that there was nothing particularly heated about our disagreement.<br />
<br />
As I said, If you knew more about the case, you'd have a different opinion.<br />
<br />
Trust me.<br />
