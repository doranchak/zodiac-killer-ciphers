An actor in the David Fincher movie ZZooddiiaacc (Jake Gyllenhaal, to be precise)
opined, in the DVD commentary, that the Zodiac case&#8212;or at least the
feature film about it&#8212;was all about dead ends. I think it may be more
accurate to say that the case itself is a network of cul-de-sacs; that each
episode appears to be a dead end, but if one steps back and looks at the
landscape more generally, a pattern begins to emerge. Of all the turn-offs on
the road to the solution, none is more out-of-the-way than the Lake Berryessa
murder. Whereas all the other murders occur at night in urban or suburban
surroundings, Lake Berryessa takes place in a pastoral setting, by a man-made
lake, on a sunny day, out in the middle of nowhere.

The Lake Berryessa episode also raises questions that even I am not prepared to
answer:

1, If the Zodiac killer predetermined his victims by name ahead of time, as
I&#8217;ve been saying all along, did he somehow follow Bryan Hartnell all the
way out to the lake? If so, his ability to keep himself next to invisible was
remarkable. That&#8217;s a long ride out into the sticks, and not even Harnell
and Shepard were aware ahead of time that they were going out to the lake.

2, Did the Zodiac killer intentionally wound Mr. Hartnell superficially, to
make sure he survived? All seven of his wounds were in the back. If one of the
two didn&#8217;t survive, his donning the costume was for nothing, since there
would be no witness to it afterward, and his donning of the costume was
significant in the overall scheme.

3. I&#8217;m also saying here that the Zodiac killer never intended to shoot
his victims, that his plan required him to stab them. If that&#8217;s true,
what if Bryan Hartnell had decided not to cooperate? We know he strongly
considered lunging for the Zodiac killer&#8217;s gun, and we also know that the
gun was loaded (the movie has him showing Hartnell the loaded clip, though the
movie DOESN&#8217;T have the Zodiac say, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to have to stab
you people,&#8221; once they were tied up, as the Graysmith book does).
So&#8212;would the Zodiac killer have shot the couple anyway?

We know, of course, that the Zodiac killer&#8217;s design wasn&#8217;t
foolproof. He could easily have been apprehended following his next murder, of
Paul Stine in Presidio Heights, and Lake Berryessa required the grudging
cooperation of his victims. Like the plane passengers on 9/11, if they&#8217;d
known what was going to happen, they wouldn&#8217;t have remained passive. This
is yet another strong suggestion that he was good at orchestrating events on
the fly.


Lake Berryessa Facts

On Saturday night, September 27, 1969, the Zodiac killer, after donning a
bizarre hooded costume which featured a bib front with the infamous Zodiac
crosshairs symbol, accosted a couple at a resort in Napa, north of San
Francisco, pointed a .45 at them and had them tie each other up, then stabbed
the boy (Bryan Hartnell) 7 times in the back, and the girl (Cecelia Ann
Shepard) 5 times in the front and 5 times in the back for a total of 10 times.

He stabbed the couple a total of 17 times. Afterward he walked up to the
highway and grafittied in black magic marker on the passenger door of
Hartnell&#8217;s Karmann Ghia:




17 Times

Notice how often the Zodiac killer used the number 17:

a. He stabbed Bryan Hartnell and Cecelia Ann Shepard 17 times total.

b. Both The Cryptogram and The 340 Character Cipher have 17 columns.

c. Even The 32 Character Cipher of June 26, 1970 isn&#8217;t two lines of 16.
It&#8217;s a top line of 17, and a bottom line of 15 characters. That cipher
was sent more than 40 years ago. Isn&#8217;t it amazing that no one&#8217;s
ever commented on that oddity (probably because they never noticed it)?

d. 17 letters were sent during the initial Bay Area Period (69-71):

Any dispute about individual mailings I will address when I get to them.

The Zodiac killer is preoccupied with the number 17 because it is simply
another reference to the section of pi that converts to the name ZODIAC.

33..11441155992266

It&#8217;s the number 3 followed by 7 decimal digits, so it&#8217;s
&#8216;37&#8217;.

33.. 11441155992266

But it&#8217;s also 1 digit before the decimal point, followed by 7 after, so
it&#8217;s also &#8216;17&#8217;.



Day Distance

The gaps between Zodiac killer events are often significant; one of the more
interesting is the relationship in time between the first and second murder
events. The distance in days from the Riverside murder (October 30, 1966) to
those at Lake Herman Road (December 20, 1968) is

778822

778822 == 22 xx 2233 xx 1177

The distance in days is 2 x 23, times 17. We&#8217;re already used to seeing 2
x 23, but notice once again the appearance of 17 as an additional factor.

I waited until now to bring up the gap in time between two earlier murders to
underscore the Zodiac killer&#8217;s use of days to measure time. If you
measure time conventionally, using years or months, you&#8217;re going to be
limited in what you can express by doing things at certain specific times. By
using day-intervals as an additional form of measurement, the Zodiac killer can
make very specific numerical points by doing things on certain days. And he
makes perhaps the most important of those points at Lake Berryessa, on
Saturday, September 27, 1969.



Times 17

As Gareth Penn has pointed out, the phrase "Times 17" identifies Michael
O&#8217;Hare very specifically. He stabbed the couple at Lake Berryessa a total
of 17 times. He went to the trouble of constructing and putting on the
ceremonial costume to celebrate this ritualistic reinforcement of his identity.

TT II MM EE SS 1177
11 0000 1111 00 000000 1100000011

1100001111000000001100000011 == 99,,774455 ((bbiinnaarryy mmaatthh))

Michael O&#8217;Hare was born on January 22, 1943. On September 27, 1969, he
was exactly 9,745 days old. Instead of signing his name at the bottom of Bryan
Hartnell&#8217;s car door, he identified himself BY KNIFE.


Deciphering VALLEJO 1

I&#8217;ve pointed out how the Zodiac killer&#8217;s first words are often the
most significant. Look at the very first word he writes on the Karmann Ghia:

VVAALLLLEEJJOO

Because the Zodiac killer so often and so successfully uses misdirection to
mask his clues, the reader looks at the first word on that car door and assumes
he&#8217;s identifying where all those dated murder-events took place.
He&#8217;s not. After all, if he were doing that, he would have written
&#8216;Napa&#8217; above the date for September, since Lake Berryessa is in
Napa, California, and not in Vallejo. But he didn&#8217;t. He doesn&#8217;t
write &#8216;Vallejo&#8217; as a reference to things past. He writes
&#8216;Vallejo&#8217; for the same reason he writes The 18 Letters at the end
of The Cryptogram&#8212;as a warning of things to come.


Deciphering VALLEJO 2

The Zodiac killer considers himself an artist. And artists make choices. Often,
their reasons only become apparent after the fact. For example, I haven&#8217;t
mentioned it until now, but Vallejo, California has an interesting acrostic if
you&#8217;re familiar with the Zodiac killer&#8217;s theme of 2-23:

VVaalllleejjoo,, CCaalliiffoorrnniiaa
VV CC
2222 33 ((aallpphhaabbeett nnuummbbeerrss))

222233


Deciphering VALLEJO 3

Speaking of acrostics, Lake Berryessa is yet another form of Michael
O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s birthday.

LLaakkee BBeerrrryyeessssaa

LL BB ((aaccrroossttiicc))
1122 22 ((aallpphhaabbeett nnuummbbeerrss))

112222

1-22 is January 22nd. The Zodiac killer uses yet another form of 1-22 over and
over again in his letters, and this form is a key to deciphering VALLEJO.


Deciphering VALLEJO 4

Look once again at that first word:

VVAALLLLEEJJOO

Any number of readers, including Robert Graysmith, have noticed an absolute
preponderance of double-Ls in The Cryptogram. Later on, the Zodiac killer will
sing a song from Gilbert & Sullivan&#8217;s The Mikado about a Little List of
possible victims. So why all the double-Ls?

LL LL
1122 1122 ((aallpphhaabbeett nnuummbbeerrss))

Twelve written flush implies muliplication.

1122 xx 1122 == 112222 == 112222 == 11--2222 == JJaannuuaarryy 2222nndd

That&#8217;s not algebraicly correct, of course. But it does conform to the
Zodiac killer&#8217;s cryptographic &#8220;fudging&#8221;. So I&#8217;m
suggesting, at least this one time, that we read double-Ls as

112222 instead of1122 1122

Fair enough?


Deciphering VALLEJO 5

Let's convert VALLEJO to alphabet numbers, as we've done with everything else.

VV AA LL LL EE JJ OO
2222 11 1122 1122 55 1100 1155

Remember, we&#8217;re converting LLs to 122 instead of 12/12.

VV AA LLLL EE JJ OO
2222 11 112222 55 1100 1155(alphabet numbers)

This formation produces two palindromes which are side by side.

222211 112222 5511001155

A palindrome is a statement which reads the same backward as forward. As Gareth
Penn suggested, symmetry is the basic design element to the Zodiac Project, so
finding palindromes should indicate we&#8217;re on the right track.


Deciphering VALLEJO 6

VV AA LLLL EE JJ OO
2222 11 112222 55 1100 1155(alphabet numbers)

222211 112222 5511001155

What do these numbers mean?
Well, we know what 122 means--January 22, Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s
birthday.

222211 BBiirrtthh 5511001155

If 122 stands for his birth, what would 221 stand for? Most likely his death,
right? Since 221 is the reverse of the birth number, 122?

222211 BBiirrtthh 5511001155

 DDeeaatthh BBiirrtthh 5511001155

 So how can Birth follow Death? Birth could follow Death in a sense, if one
became famous--or infamous--after one&#8217;s death, as the Zodiac killer
intended to do.

The reader will object that the Zodiac killer was already famous. He was, but
in a relatively limited sphere. The Zodiac killer was well-known on the West
Coast, particularly to baby boomers and their parents, but as the David Fincher
movie demonstrated, not a lot of people in the rest of the country were
familiar with him.

But having set the stage with his Zodiac kille serial murder episodes, Michael
O&#8217;Hare intended to go out with a very big bang. Having achieved that
criminal catastrophe as a final master stroke, he would be genuinely infamous.
And, in a sense, he would be born again as a legendary evil-doer.

So, it wouldn&#8217;t really be Death and then Birth. It would be Death,
followed by Rebirth, right?

DDeeaatthh RReebbiirrtthh 55 1100 1155

Note that if you divide the following numbers by five, the statement suggests
Death and Rebirth as zero, as a starting point:

DDeeaatthh && RReebbiirrtthh,, 11 22 33

Make sense?


Deciphering VALLEJO 7

VVAA LLLL EE JJ OO
222211 112222 55 1100 1155(alphabet numbers)

222211 112222 5511001155

But dividing 51015 by 3 instead of by 5 produces an even more startling result:

DDeeaatthh && RReebbiirrtthh 5511001155

5511,,001155 // 33 == 1177,,000055

DDeeaatthh && RReebbiirrtthh,, 1177,,000055

In other words, Death and Rebirth is followed by 17,005.

As I've already noted, another reason the Lake Berryessa murder is important is
that it introduces the idea of measuring Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s life in
days.

The 17,005th day of Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s life would have been Saturday,
August 12, 1989. So if his Death and Rebirth happens the day prior, it would be
on Friday, August 11, 1989.

Additional reason to believe that&#8217;s the target date is that August 11th
is Day 223 of 1989. He chose Vallejo as a murder venue at least partly because
the name of the town tells you when The Zodiac Project will reach The End.

Note also that the principle of symmetry is adhered to. Vallejo is, at least
nominally, the beginning of the Zodiac Project. That&#8217;s why he sends the
first &#8220;This is the Zodiac speaking&#8221; letter to The Vallejo Times-
Herald and NOT to The San Francisco Chronicle.

But VALLEJO also tells you when it will all come to an end.

The 18 Letters tell you WHERE the final event will take place, and VALLEJO
tells you WHEN. Like The 18 Letters, VALLEJO makes two statements.

His Death and Rebirth will be the beginning of his legend.

And Friday, August 11, 1989 will be The End.


Renaissance

The reader will see the Zodiac killer refer to this idea of Death & Rebirth
over and over again. In fact, at one point he actually sets a car on fire to
make the point! We&#8217;ll get to that momentarily.

In the meantime, note that Dante&#8217;s Inferno is yet again a perfect vehicle
for a story about rebirth. Why? Because the Renaissance, which means Rebirth,
began in the Italian city-states of the 14th century. In fact, in many ways,
The Divine Comedy, and in particular The Inferno, serves as a backdrop for all
of Western art over the following several centuries. That the Zodiac killer has
turned the story and its symbolism upside down should not surprise us.


Lake Berryessa Review

Amazing how we&#8217;ve only looked here at three words the Zodiac killer wrote
on a car door (BY KNIFE and VALLEJO)! It&#8217;s yet another example of how
economical his real messages are.
