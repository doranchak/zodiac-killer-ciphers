Just to keep the What's New article reasonably short, I'm going to move its
archive over to _Z_o_d_i_a_c_K_i_l_l_e_r_F_a_c_t_s_I_n_f_o_._c_o_m; if you haven't checked in here in a
while, you might want to click over there for the older updates.

I pretty much finished what I'm going to say on _R_i_v_e_r_s_i_d_e_ _R_e_v_i_s_i_t_e_d. It's
disheartening that so much detail about the Bates murder has been lost since I
downloaded those pages in 2003.

My work on that day and the aftermath of it has been pretty exhaustive. William
Manchester obviously did more with the four days of the JFK assassination in
TThhee DDeeaatthh ooff aa PPrreessiiddeenntt, but he wasn't relying as much on secondary sources as
I've had to do.

I posted what I think is a groundbreaking article on the _C_h_e_r_i_ _B_a_t_e_s_ _a_u_t_o_p_s_y
this morning. I will shortly be expanding on it with an article entitled
_A_u_t_o_p_s_y_ _C_o_n_f_e_s_s_i_o_n, which links the Bates autopsy to The Confession Letter.
There has been speculation as to whether The Confession Letter was really
written by the killer of Cheri Bates. If you read the autopsy carefully, it
becomes clear that portions of The Confession Letter were actually written to
"cover up" for what might be found in the autopsy. The autopsy casts doubt as
to what the killer's motives were; The Confession Letter clouds the issue by
offering an explanation for what the medical examiner found . . . or, to be
exact, DIDN'T find.

I still can't believe I didn't notice that Bently posted the 1991 edition of
TZMS on Zodiac Zee, not the 1993 edition. I'm still processing that mistake.
It's understandable that I assumed I'd sent the Napa Sentinel edition (1993) to
Harry Martin, but I should have taken a closer look at that scanned index page.
I pulled the box with the 1991 edition off the shelf in my attic and looked at
it briefly. The 1991 edition was an edited version of the 1990 edition (which
was mailed to Harvard); the 1993 edition was completely rewritten,
restructured, and has the most cryptography of all the books. I'm hoping that
all my fans who have emailed me over the past couple years asking to see the
physical books are reading them now. I will post the 1990 and 1991 editions
sometime between now and the end of the year. By the way, I was surprised to
see Zodiac Zee still available on The Wayback Machine, though all you get is
the home page. Apparently Zodiac Zee was the original version of ZKS, judging
by who was moderating it.

I wrote more about the Riverside crime scene on ZKT. My plan is to put up two
parallel articles, one called What Didn't Happen, which features the true crime
narrative as it's been presented these past 45+ years and explains why it's
wrong, detail by detail; the second article will be called Riverside Timeline,
which will present What I Think Happened.

Oops!

I don't know why I didn't notice this before. For the past couple of years,
pretty much since I've been aware of people talking about TZMS on the Internet,
I've assumed that they were talking about the 1993 edition. That's the edition
that was dedicated (see the copyright page) to Harry Martin (mainly because he
expressed curiosity about it), so I assumed that edition is what Bently had
scanned onto the Zodiac Zee website.

Apparently I was wrong. I just took a look at the Table of Contents page that
was scanned onto ZKF and OPORD, and it's not from the 1993 edition.



It's from the 1991 edition. At least, I think it is. I haven't gone up to my
attic to check the 1991 manuscript yet, but it can't be the 1993 edition
because the Tables of Contents don't match.

I'll have to see if I can find Zodiac Zee on The Wayback Machine (I doubt it),
but it appears that the 1993 edition I just scanned onto the site hasn't been
seen by anyone except the faculty and administration at Cal-Berkeley.

I recall talking to Harry Martin on the phone circa 1993 or so but I don't
remember what the context of the conversation was. I'm guessing what happened
is that I promised to send him some material, and I had a few extra copies of
the 1991 edition laying around so that's what I sent him. I then later put
together a new edition and dedicated it to him.

I spent much of the day talking to the GoDaddy techs about their new website
builder. What they told me turned out not to be true, at least from my end, but
I did manage to get TTZZMMSS 11999933 back up on the site, now split into halves. The
bad news is that I spent several days loading a 500-page manuscript a page at a
time onto the website; the good news is I figured out, with a little bit of
tech help, how to do it 15 pages at a time, which is a lot less tedious. I'll
be posting the 1990 and 1991 editions later this year, but probably not next
week. As I said, the 1993 edition is by far the best of the physical books.

Okay, I give up. I tried posting TTZZMMSS 11999933 as a single website page and it
looks like the word processing program crashes if you put too many scans in one
place, so I'll have to break it up.

I wrote a few more paragraphs on ZKT. The more I look at the Bates murder
scene, the more ridiculous the true crime narrative about it that you find in
all the Zodiac books, on all the Zodiac websites, on all the Zodiac TV shows
and Zodiac message boards becomes.

Hey, don't look at me. I'm the Morse/binary guy, right? I just started looking
at the conventional evidence in the past year, and none of it makes sense. It's
a little ironic when you have people jumping up and down about THE FACTS, and a
lot of THE FACTS turn out to be wrong.
