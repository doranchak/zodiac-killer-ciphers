This book is unique.

It purports to solve a mystery&#8212;the Zodiac serial murder case&#8212;which
has puzzled the world for decades, and which most of the police agencies
involved have effectively&#8212;if not officially--declared unsolvable.

It presents a solution far more elaborate--and much more significant in its
impact on the world--than has ever been imagined by even the most ardent
&#8220;Zodiologist&#8221;.

And it suggests, as the ultimate end of The Zodiac Project, a criminal
catastrophe scheduled for the late summer of 1989: The Terminus Event.

The Terminus Event would be similar in scope to the Oklahoma City Bombing of
1995, but perhaps, in figurative terms, more closely resemble September 11th,
2001.

What would have happened if, back in early December of 1941, American military
leaders had taken the Purple Code warnings about Pearl Harbor seriously?

They obviously didn&#8217;t, but that mistake informed their subsequent
decisions at Midway, where knowledge of the Japanese Naval Code led to the most
decisive military victory in American history. This historical precedent was
not lost on the Zodiac conspirators; there are, in fact, numerous references to
Midway throughout the Zodiac literature.

Thus, in addition to solving the Zodiac mystery, this book tells the story of a
terrible event that was scheduled a quarter-century in advance . . . but
didn&#8217;t happen, because the Zodiac code was broken in time.

This book may appeal to &#8220;puzzle people&#8221;, because it solves the most
diabolical&#8212;and I use that term metaphorically&#8212;puzzle ever put
before the public.

And, while you don't have to be a genius to understand it, being bright, or at
least having an active imagination, will definitely help.


Preface

Solving serial murder cases is about looking for patterns.

The murders may seem completely random, and aspects of the crimes may be
happenstance, but somewhere, tucked in with the details of each individual
death, there&#8217;s a common element. It's up to the investigator to identify
that element and find the pattern leading to the perpetrator.

The Zodiac murders contain so many disparate elements as to defy description,
and discourage even a simple outline. Most of its detectives&#8212;professional
and amateur&#8212;have eventually thrown up their hands at the information
overload the case presents.

The pattern suggested by this book is so complex and unprecedented, it is
likely to short-circuit the brains of all but the most patient and intelligent
readers.

I can&#8217;t help that&#8212;the solution is what it is. The best I can do is
present it as simply as possible.
And, although this book offers an argument, I don&#8217;t pretend it would
stand up in court . . . at least, not by itself. I&#8217;m sure most experts on
the Zodiac case will dismiss it out of hand, and that&#8217;s fine with me. I
offer this solution because it&#8217;s my duty to do so, all the more so since
I&#8217;m confident it&#8217;s the correct one.

My theory assumes, for example, that the Zodiac murders were the brain child of
four people, though only one of them physically committed the crimes.

It also assumes that the murders themselves, though they may seem senseless
individually, do make sense in context.

Finally, I&#8217;m not just a casual spectator turned amateur journalist; I was
actively involved in what ultimately happened, although not as a perpetrator.

In fact, one of the Zodiac killer&#8217;s letters was written about me.

So, before I tell you who the Zodiac killer is . . . I&#8217;d better tell you
who I am.


My Story

I was born in New York City, on 34th Street in midtown Manhattan, in April
1951.

My family moved to Pittsburgh in 1955 when my dad&#8217;s company, Crucible
Steel, relocated its corporate headquarters. I attended St. Philomena parochial
school, Taylor Allderdice public high school, and finally The University of
Pittsburgh, where I received a BA in English Writing in 1972. Here's the
picture from my high school yearbook; I'm way down on the lower left of the
page, as if I'd been named Most Likely To Get To The Bottom Of Things.



Largely as a result of the notoriety of New York City's Son of Sam case in the
summer of 1977, I developed an interest in serial killers. The idea of someone
terrorizing an entire city by walking up to strangers in cars with a .44 hand
gun and blasting away, and then smugly writing to the newspapers about it, was
morbidly fascinating to me. It became even more so when I found out David
Berkowitz was a postal worker, just like me.

Little did I know that I would eventually become a well-known researcher and
investigator of the Zodiac killer, who undoubtedly inspired The Son of Sam,
even down to his killing of couples in cars, and who was the first serial
killer to write to the newspapers (since Jack The Ripper's famous letter was
probably a hoax, and The Mad Bomber didn't actually kill anyone).

The best example of the investigative material available on serial killers back
then was TThhee OOnnllyy LLiivviinngg WWiittnneessss, a book by Steven Michaud and Hugh Aynesworth
about Ted Bundy, which consisted largely of conversations in which Bundy,
unwilling to admit his guilt, "speculated" about how a killer like the one he
was accused of being might go about collecting his victims. The two reporters
writing the book, and the reader, had to assume that Bundy was giving them a
First Person account of each murder, in effect, a How-To.

In 1984, I joined Mensa, a society for people with IQ scores in the upper 2% of
the population.


Zodiac Murders

I never went looking for the Zodiac killer. He came looking for me.

One day in 1985, he showed up in my mailbox.

In the summer of 1985, The Mensa Bulletin carried an article on the Zodiac
murders (&#8220;The Calculus Of Evil&#8221;) which suggested that the Zodiac
killer&#8217;s purpose all along had been to create a design on the map, a
pattern marked off by the placement of his victims.



Because of my aforementioned interest in serial killers, I wrote to the author
of the article, one Gareth Penn, who identified then-Harvard lecturer Michael
O&#8217;Hare as the Zodiac killer. Between 1985 and 1989, Gareth and I
corresponded often and talked on the phone about as often.

I became convinced Michael O&#8217;Hare WAS the Zodiac killer. But, by 1989,
enough things about Gareth himself didn&#8217;t add up that I came to believe
he must also be involved . . . in what I will call The Zodiac Project.

The Zodiac Project was intended as a giant puzzle, and Gareth&#8217;s role was
to be its PR man, giving away just enough information to allow the solution to
present itself, if you knew where to look and what you were looking for.

This book presents the solution as I see it.

If you make the same assumptions about the Zodiac killer that I do, everything
he does makes sense. If you reject those assumptions, the Zodiac killer&#8217;s
actions are nonsensical, and even at times self-defeating and contradictory. In
any case: this is me, and this is my theory.


Disclaimer

It may seem odd for me to disclaim anything immediately after announcing my
ownership of this theory, but . . .


This book is a simplified version of earlier editions of TThhee ZZooddiiaacc
MMuurrddeerrss&&##88221122;;SSoollvveedd!!, a new edition which has the benefit of years of
hindsight. The most recent previous edition was 1994; this edition is 2010/
2011.

Because it&#8217;s simplified, I don&#8217;t do a lot of cryptographic analysis
on the page. I don&#8217;t always provide all the dots for you to connect, and
at times going from one dot to another may seem a bit of a stretch. In any
case, I am sometimes commenting not on what seemed to happen, or what the
Zodiac killer appeared to be saying, but on what I think he intended. I know
many experts on the case are going to object to this approach.

However, I&#8217;m presenting a theory of the case as a whole. So telling me
that a particular reading doesn&#8217;t follow directly from what&#8217;s there
in front of you isn&#8217;t a real objection--at least not to me.

If that bothers you, stop right here. Not everyone is going to &#8220;get it",
and after two decades of doing this, I have no illusions that my solution is
ever going to be accepted by more than a handful of people, much less become
The Official Solution.

In other words, no one's forcing you to read this. But do me one small favor:

Don't object to this book because, "It doesn't PROVE anything!"

You can't PROVE anyone's the Zodiac killer in a book. You can only do that
outside the pages of a book, and for that matter offline, by providing physical
evidence of guilt.

What you CAN do in a book is make a circumstantial case that someone is the
Zodiac killer, by demonstrating a consistent pattern in the murders and letters
and other events which points to a specific person or persons as being the
author(s).

As Polonius says in Shakespeare's _H_a_m_l_e_t, "Though this be madness, yet there is
method in't."

That's EXACTLY what I'm saying about the Zodiac killer; actions that seem
bizarre and even random are, in fact, entirely consistent within a particular
pattern that continually demonstrates itself in his behavior.


Obituary

I've often felt, during the last 20 years, as if I were the protagonist in a
science fiction story, trying to convince people of a fantastic idea that
couldn't possibly be true. In H. G. Wells's TThhee TTiimmee MMaacchhiinnee, the Time Traveler
tries to convince his drawing room guests that he's journeyed back from a place
hundreds of thousands of years in the future.

The only physical evidence he has to show for this ordeal are two limp white
flowers, put in his pocket by Weena, the Eloi woman whose life he saved in that
distant time.

The Zodiac Project has always struck me as an example of Morlock Architecture.
The White Sphinx, though imposing in its functional menace, and forbidding in
its dark mystery, also houses a horrifying secret: that it literally and
figuratively eats people.

My own personal time machine has been hijacked and kept inside that structure
the past two decades; this book is my walking inside and dragging my life back
out, into the sunlight.

This book is in memory of

I've taken, in recent years, to reading the obituary section of my local
newspaper, not for its details of death, but for its hope and remembrance, for
the messages left there for those who were loved once in life, and are loved
still.

The victims are the white flowers of The Zodiac Project; they are the only
things about it that were not grown in darkness, that still live on in the
faded sunlight of our memories, and are still worth cherishing.

"And I have by me, for my comfort, two strange white flowers - shriveled now,
and brown and flat and brittle - to witness that even when mind and strength
had gone, gratitude and a mutual tenderness still lived on in the heart of
man."
H. G. Wells, TThhee TTiimmee MMaacchhiinnee


Michael O'Hare

Most of this book consists of cryptographic material which points to an
identification of Michael O&#8217;Hare as the Zodiac killer. In this chapter I
will present conventional aspects of Mr. O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s identity, partly
to give the reader some idea of whom I&#8217;m talking about, and partly to
highlight some of the things Mr. O&#8217;Hare has in common with the Zodiac
killer.

Michael Henry O&#8217;Hare (seen here in a recent photo) is the Zodiac killer.



He is the perpetrator of the murder events committed by the Zodiac killer; it
is his face that you see on the Zodiac killer WANTED posters.



The only thing that might eliminate him from suspicion is his &#8220;real
life&#8221; identity as an academic professional, and this dichotomy in his
life, like Clark Kent merely putting on a pair of glasses and acting
differently to hide his identity as Superman, is one of the main motifs of the
Zodiac killer&#8217;s secret messages. Other than that incongruity, all the
knowledge and expertise the Zodiac killer exhibits may be found in Michael
O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s background:

For example, Mr. O&#8217;Hare has engineering degrees from Harvard; throughout
the Zodiac lore there are numerous undertones of an engineering background,
including the Zodiac killer's knowledge of bombs and explosives, his
familiarity with academic terms such as the radian and the Wide Flange Beam,
and the very use of the Zodiac symbol, which besides resembling a crosshairs is
also a surveyor's symbol (often seen spray-painted on streets and sidewalks
where construction work is being done) for locating positions on a (USGS) map.

Perhaps the best argument in favor of someone like Michael O&#8217;Hare is the
behavior of those who encountered the Zodiac killer. Paul Stine picked him up
in the theatre district despite already having a fare. The police driver who
saw him on the street that night assumed he was a resident of (upscale)
Presidio Heights. And Kathleen Johns described him as so &#8220;clean-
cut&#8221;, she had no fear of him until he (apparently) began threatening her.

Incidentally, I&#8217;m aware that books have been put out accusing this
(deceased) relative or that (deceased) derelict of being the Zodiac killer, and
these books invariably feature photos which supposedly resemble the Zodiac
killer sketch, or handwriting exhibits in which one or two letters are shown to
be similar to the Zodiac killer&#8217;s.

Michael O&#8217;Hare looks EXACTLY like the Zodiac killer. And documents in the
public domain reveal his handwriting to EXACTLY match that of the Zodiac
killer, even though the Zodiac killer&#8217;s letter-formations were extremely
idiosyncratic, pretty much throughout the alphabet.


Identification

Michael O&#8217;Hare was born in New York City on Friday, January 22, 1943.


He attended Bronx Science High School in New York City, graduating in the
spring of 1960. He began attending Harvard as an undergrad in the fall of 1960,
and was a member of the school&#8217;s Rifle Team that year. He is the
registered owner of at least one type of Zodiac killer firearm, a .22 rifle
(the same caliber as that used at Lake Herman Road).

He received bachelor&#8217;s degrees in Architectural Science (1964) and
Structural Engineering (1968), a master&#8217;s degree in Architecture (1968),
and a Ph. D. in Engineering (1973), all from Harvard. His doctoral dissertation
was entitled &#8220;Classroom Utilization And Space Management&#8221;.

O&#8217;Hare worked for the consulting firm of Arthur Little in their San
Francisco office in the late 60s and early 70s. He has also worked for The
Boston Museum as a consultant.

He was an associate professor at MIT from 1971 to 1979, then worked for the
state of Massachusetts from 1979 to 1981. He was a lecturer in Public Policy at
The John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard from 1981 to 1990. While he
worked at Harvard, Michael O&#8217;Hare lived in a house at 12 Abbottsford Rd.,
Brookline, MA 02146.

He currently lives at 22996622 RRuusssseellll SStt.. BBeerrkkeelleeyy,, CCAA 9944770055 ((551100--554488--44116688)).

He has been a lecturer at Cal-Berkeley since 1991.

Handwriting

I&#8217;m not a handwriting expert, but I don&#8217;t think you have to be one
to see that Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s handwriting is all but identical to
the Zodiac killer&#8217;s. Here are handwriting samples from both Michael
O&#8217;Hare and &#8220;the Zodiac&#8221;.



The bulk of the O&#8217;Hare samples, as you can see from the dated entry, are
taken from his marriage application of April 16, 1969, and were obtained
through the efforts of a private detective. The Zodiac killer samples were
published in newspapers and are in the public domain. I have arranged the
comparisons alphabetically, though a few letters (e. g., &#8216;J&#8217;) were
not available. Also, since Mr. O&#8217;Hare was writing on an official form, he
used more block and capital letters than usual. The similarities are
nonetheless self-evident:

The reader will note that some of the samples are not absolutely identical;
however, in some cases I felt it important to illustrate where Michael
O&#8217;Hare forms a letter identically to the Zodiac killer. This is
particularly noticeable in the extreme rightward slant of the upper
&#8216;d&#8217;-loop, and in the odd mid-letter beginning of the small
&#8216;e&#8217;. Note, as another example, the curious &#8220;bishop&#8217;s
staff&#8221; appearance of the &#8216;f&#8217;, and the &#8220;check-
mark&#8221; &#8216;r&#8217;. Even though the &#8216;x&#8217;s are not
identical, note that they both produce a &#8220;hedge-clipper&#8221;
&#8216;x&#8217;, wider and more concave on the right side. I believe the most
striking quality of the Zodiac&#8217;s script is its eccentricity, particularly
his B, D, G, M, R, S, W, and Y. One would think that the more eccentric a
particular letter-formation was, the more difficult it would be for him to
disguise. Keep in mind that, since the O'Hare samples are from April 16, 1969,
and the Zodiac killer did not make his debut AS the Zodiac killer until July
1969, Michael O'Hare cannot be said to have copied, consciously or otherwise,
the Zodiac killer's handwriting. His own samples are older than the Zodiac
killer's.

Michael O&#8217;Hare may have successfully varied his hand in some instances,
but he produces the most eccentric letters virtually identically to the way the
Zodiac killer produces them.


Police Sketch

Below are three photographic views of Michael Henry O&#8217;Hare, above a
WANTED poster put out by The San Francisco Police Department. The poster itself
has been altered, but I would like the reader to first notice something about
the photographic progression on top.



As the pictures make clear, Michael O&#8217;Hare has been balding at a regular
rate since his college days. With this in mind, compare the Zodiac sketch with
the altered Harvard graduation picture of 21-year-old Michael O&#8217;Hare.
Note that the receding hairline in the sketch is about what one would have
expected had there been a 1969 picture between the 1964 and 1971 versions.

The unaltered poster had two sketches, the second of which has been called
inaccurate by Kathleen Johns, the woman who spent three hours in the Zodiac
killer&#8217;s company in March, 1970. Ms. Johns insisted that the Zodiac
killer was younger than the second sketch suggested, that the man she rode with
was in his mid-20s rather than his mid-30s. I am therefore using the sketch
that witnesses from two Zodiac sightings (Michael Mageau and Kathleen Johns)
agree on, rather than the one produced from a description by Donald Fouke, an
SFPD patrolman who thinks he saw the Zodiac killer on Jackson Street for
fifteen seconds after the Stine murder.

I realize a sketch is not definitive, but given all the other coincidences that
seem to link the Zodiac killer to Michael O&#8217;Hare, it&#8217;s interesting
that this sketch would so closely approximate the general shape of his face,
the width of his mouth, the shape and size of his nose, the line of his
eyebrows, and even his hairline as it would have looked in 1969.


Conspirators

This book concentrates almost entirely on Michael O&#8217;Hare, because he was
the &#8220;trigger man&#8221;, and because almost all of the cryptographic
evidence points to him. Howerever, in addition to Michael O&#8217;Hare, The
Zodiac Project was planned and executed by at least three others:

GGaarreetthh PPeennnn, (January 1, 1941-), a Cal-Berkeley graduate with degrees in German
and library science. It was apparently his job to publicize the cryptographic
solution to the Zodiac murders. Reading his material on the Zodiac murders, in
particular his self-published book, TTiimmeess 1177, provided me with the necessary
clues to the real solution, which is presented in this book.



BBeerrttaa MMaarrggoouulliieess, (September 7, 1907-March 20, 1996), Michael
O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s mother, a sculptor associated with The New York Group in
the 1950s. The Zodiac Project, at least in geographic terms, is a conceptual
form of Earth Art, creating designs on the planet itself, geometric formations
recognizable from the perspective of space.



and HHuugghh PPeennnn, (October 19, 1913-June 18, 1995), Gareth&#8217;s father, an
agent for the California Attorney General&#8217;s office and The California
Highway Patrol, headquartered in Sacramento. Hugh Penn had several personal
attributes that would contribute to The Zodiac Project: he had a degree from
San Jose State and had worked in cryptography during World War II, he liked
math, plus his background in criminal investigation would be invaluable to a
serial killer.

Sorry, no picture of Hugh Penn. I'm working on it.

Okay, I found a picture of Hugh Penn on OPORD, posted there in 2007 by The
Foreigner:

This book is a mostly chronological analysis of The Zodiac Project.

It will address the questions Who, What, Where, When, and How.

But first, let&#8217;s find out Why.


Pi

This is the hardest chapter in the whole book--probably because it's math and
geometry! If you can make it through this, you should be able to coast through
the remaining 24 sections.

Why would intelligent and educated people like Michael O&#8217;Hare, Berta
Margoulies, Gareth Penn, and Hugh Penn plan and execute a serial murder case?
The answer to that can be found at the end of the Academy Award-winning short
animation film from 1968, WWhhyy MMaann CCrreeaatteess. Man creates to express his identity.
He creates to say, &#8220;I AM.&#8221;

In the late 1950s, Berta Margoulies was a relatively obscure member of the New
York Group, a collection of Avant Garde artists that included modern art
superstars like Jackson Pollock, Robert Motherwell, and Mark Rothko. Since the
time of the Renaissance, artists had been stretching the conception of what Art
was&#8212;what Art could be&#8212;and each period in Art History was a new
chapter in that movement until, by the early 1960s, the Avant Garde not only
confronted the public, it was blatantly antagonistic. Pollock, Motherwell, and
Rothko threw paint at their canvases. George Segal created plaster casts of
ordinary people and put them in mundane situations. Andy Warhol painted cans of
Campbell&#8217;s Soup.

Christo Javacheff attempted to gift-wrap The Brooklyn Bridge. Michael Heizer
excavated huge holes in the Nevada desert so his designs could be photographed
from space. I believe Berta Margoulies conceived The Zodiac Project as a multi-
planed intersection of Art and Real Life. As such, it was part cryptographic
puzzle, part Earth Art, part Happening, and even a design in time itself---
a clockwork, if you will, which is why timepieces play so prominent a role in
it.

It was composed, primarily, to resemble a serial murder case. Of course, since
real people who were not privy to the artistic intent died, it WAS also a
serial murder case. This still wasn&#8217;t a new idea. Agatha Christie&#8217;s
TThhee AABBCC MMuurrddeerrss contains a plot device that resembles the Zodiac Project, at
least alphabetically.

What made The Zodiac Project new was its unique approach to Identity. Remember,
Identity itself is crucial to the artistic process, because artists always sign
their work, and because art is created to express one&#8217;s identity. The
Zodiac Project expressed that identity with every stroke. The Zodiac
killer&#8217;s signature was everywhere. Its central figure, Michael
O&#8217;Hare, Berta&#8217;s son, happened to have an identity that was
numerically interchangable, when translated into his own private language, with
the most common constant in mathematics. This chapter will demonstrate how the
one translates into the other.


Radian Clue

I want to cover the events of The Zodiac Project in chronological order, but
I&#8217;ll begin with The Radian Clue because it&#8217;s the starting point for
the cryptographic speculation about the case. Though several websites and
television shows have featured this clue, none to my knowledge has made even
the most basic follow-up assumptions about it . . . until now. In his letter of
June 26, 1970, the Zodiac killer sent a Phillips 66 service station map with a
circle drawn over the Naval Radio Station on Mt. Diablo in California.



The Naval Radio Station is situated at the intersection of The Mount Diablo
Meridian and The Mount Diablo Base Line. It houses United States Geological
Survey (USGS) Vertical Angle Bench Mark (VABM) 3849. I don&#8217;t think there
can be much doubt that it is this specific point the map&#8217;s sender is
highlighting, especially since this point was used as the basis for all
topological measurements in the San Francisco Bay Area.

In a postscript to a letter the following month, the Zodiac said:

PPSS.. TThhee MMtt.. DDiiaabblloo CCooddee ccoonncceerrnnss
RRaaddiiaannss && ## iinncchheess aalloonngg tthhee rraaddiiaannss

A radian is a mathematical constant, an angle of 57.29DEG.&nbsp; If you draw a
radian apexed on VABM 3849, so that the south leg of the angle goes through the
Zodiac murder site at Washington & Cherry Streets in San Francisco . . . the
north leg of that angle will go through the murder sites at Lake Herman Road
and Blue Rock Springs.



Frankly, I don&#8217;t see any alternative to the obvious implication: The
Zodiac killer committed those murders to create that angle on the map.


Pi Radian

a, The Zodiac killer shot to death two teenagers, David Faraday and Betty Lou
Jensen, at Lake Herman Road on December 20, 1968.

b, The Zodiac killer murdered Darlene Ferrin and wounded Michael Mageau in The
Blue Rock Springs Golf Course parking lot on July 4, 1969.

and c, He killed cab driver Paul Stine in Presidio Heights on October 11, 1969.

He did all that to create points on a map which would form a radian. Clearly,
the Zodiac killer went to a lot of trouble to create that angle. But why? And
what is a &#8216;radian&#8217;, anyway? Besides being 57.29DEG?&nbsp; A radian
gets its value from the math constant pi, whose symbol is &#8216;p&#8217;.

ppii == 33..11441155992266 .. .. ..

A radian is, in fact, a circle divided by 2pi.

336600DDEEGG &&##224477;; 22((33..11441155992266 .. .. .. )) == 5577..2299DDEEGG

So the value for the radian is determined by pi. And pi itself isn&#8217;t some
esoteric concept. Pi is the most common constant in mathematics, an irrational
number measuring the relationship between the circumference of a circle and its
diameter. Versions of pi can be found dating back to the time of the pyramids.
In fact, if you want to know why the killer chose the name ZODIAC, the answer
is as easy as pi.


Pi Zodiac

Most writers on the Zodiac murders have assumed the killer&#8217;s chosen name
had something to do with astrology. Robert Graysmith, in the paperback edition
of _Z_o_d_i_a_c, spent several pages (244-252) discussing an astrological schedule
for the murders. I don&#8217;t find what he says compelling, or even
intelligible. Nor does the killer ever make any obvious references to the
astronomical Zodiac, which is a section of the observable sky.

If the radian and pi are essentially numerical, is it possible the name ZODIAC
has something to do with mathematics? At the end of the Zodiac killer&#8217;s
Exorcist Letter of January 29, 1974, the killer says, "Me - 37".



This appeared to be one of his end-of-letter &#8220;scorecard&#8221;
statements, where he would place a constantly ascending number next to his own
name and a zero beside SFPD, The San Francisco Police Department. Did he really
mean he&#8217;d killed 37 people? Or did he mean, &#8220; I&#8217;m the number
3, followed by 7 decimal digits of pi.&#8221;? Let&#8217;s test that
hypothesis! Let&#8217;s take the whole number 3 and the following 7 decimal
digits of pi and see if it spells anything!

33..11441155992266

First, we&#8217;ll separate the numbers like this:

33.. 11 44 1155 99 2266

. . . and then apply the corresponding letters of the alphabet:

33.. 11 44 1155 99 2266
CC AA DD OO II ZZ

When the letters of the alphabet are applied to the first 8 numbers of pi, you
get an anagram of the name ZODIAC!


Binary Pi

Assuming I&#8217;m right, why would an academic professional like Michael
O&#8217;Hare want to evoke the mathematical constant pi by using the name
ZODIAC? If the Zodiac killer was really creating a design on the map, he was
dabbling in a form of environmental art similar to that of Christo Javacheff
and Michael Heizer, using the planet itself as his canvas. And we know that
artists always sign their work, so we would expect Michael O&#8217;Hare to use
a name that somehow identifies him. If ZODIAC evokes pi, how does pi identify
Michael O&#8217;Hare?

Well, here&#8217;s the odd thing: The mathematical constant pi DOES identify
Michael O&#8217;Hare. You have to massage it a little, but the result is pretty
blatant. We again start with the section of pi that converts to ZODIAC:

33..11441155992266

Then we convert just that section of the constant to binary math.

33..11441155992266 == 1111..0000110000110000000011111111111100111100110011


M.ERAHO

We&#8217;re starting with the binary form of the part of pi that converts to an
anagram of ZODIAC.

33..11441155992266 == 1111..0000110000110000000011111111111100111100110011

This time, we&#8217;ll separate the binary digits like this:

1111.. 00 001100 0011 00000000 111111 11111100111100110011

. . . and, once again, convert the result to letters, but this time using
binary Morse code, with 1 for dash and 0 for dot:

1111.. 00 001100 0011 00000000 111111 11111100111100110011
MM.. EE RR AA HH OO ((994499))

As you can see, the binary form of pi converts to Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s
first initial and his last name . . . spelled backward.

Suppose you were doodling around in Morse code and binary math as a teenager,
and discovered that a form of your name was embedded in the most common
mathematical constant? Suppose you then decided to create a serial murder/
mystery in which virtually everything you did revealed--in some cryptic way--
your identity? Is it possible you&#8217;d choose a name (ZODIAC) that referred
back to that math constant containing a form of your real name?

By the way, just in case you were wondering, 949 is the postal zip code of San
Rafael (94903), which was the postmark on the last known mailing during the
Zodiac period, The Count Marco Card of July 9, 1974. It was also, during the
years of Gareth Penn&#8217;s &#8220;press agent&#8221; activities (1980-1989),
the first three numbers of his zip code.



Pi Examples

This isn&#8217;t as &#8220;far out&#8221; as you might think. Police refer to
the process of witnesses picking a suspect out of a lineup or a mug shot
grouping as &#8216;Positive Identification&#8217;. So those letters, P-I,
literally refer to identification of a perpetrator by conventional
investigative means. But if the whole construct is based on pi, I hear you
saying, we&#8217;re going to find references to pi all over The Zodiac Project,
right? Well, let me cite a few examples just off the top of my head:

a, The angular value of the north leg of the Zodiac killer&#8217;s radian is
314DEG.&nbsp; 314 is 100 times the truncated common form of pi, 3.14.



b, The Zodiac killer wrote to lawyer Melvin Belli because his specialty was
Personal Injury--P. I.. Belli also lived on Telegraph Hill, a clue to the
Zodiac&#8217;s use of Morse code.

c, The Zodiac killer quoted from Gilbert and Sullivan&#8217;s The Mikado in two
letters (July 25, 1970 and January 29, 1974) because The Mikado premiered on
March 14, 1885. March 14 is 3-14, a date often referred to by math nerds as
&#8220;pi-day&#8221;.

d, The Zodiac killer kidnapped, murdered, and buried Donna Lass, whose life
straddled the California/Nevada borders. She lived in South Lake Tahoe,
California, but worked at The Sahara Hotel, a casino in Stateline, Nevada. The
border is a manifestation of pi.



I will point out more examples when we get to them.


Geometric Metaphors

How is a serial killer similar to Superman or any other comic book superhero?

Because both have secret identities. Superman was also Clark Kent. In like
manner, The Green River Killer was also Gary Ridgway. Seattle Ted was also Ted
Bundy. The Son of Sam was also David Berkowitz. In that sense, they were all
two-faced, like the Roman god Janus. In Roman mythology, Janus was the god of
gates, doors, doorways, beginnings, and endings. He was commonly depicted as
having two faces, pointed in opposite directions, 180DEG apart.



In the Zodiac killer&#8217;s Lake Tahoe Card of March 22, 1971, he punches a
hole in the upper right side of the card. But he also uses the puncher along
the top edge of the card, creating a series of semi-circles. Why?



Because he&#8217;s replacing a straight line (180DEG) with a semi-circle
(180DEG).&nbsp; He does that to emphasize 180DEG as a metaphor for a secret
identity. But people do that generally as well. If someone acts in a way
that&#8217;s the opposite of the way he normally acts, we say he&#8217;s done
an about-face, or &#8216;a 180&#8217;.

Incidentally, 180DEG is also p (3.1415926 . . .) times the radian,
57.29DEG.&nbsp; So 180DEG is a geometric metaphor for a secret identity. This
is why the Zodiac killer reviews The Exorcist in the first place. The girl in
the film, played by Linda Blair, has two interesting powers. She can project
vomit through the air (which might come in handy), and she can rotate her head
180DEG.&nbsp; That the letter was sent in January (for Janus) is further
evidence that this was the Zodiac killer&#8217;s intent.


Radian Supplement

A bright reader might object at this point that there was no reason for the
Zodiac killer to create a radian on the map. Although the radian value is based
on pi, both the name ZODIAC and the Morse/binary form of Michael
O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s name are related to pi itself. So why use a radian? Why
not, say, blow up a pie factory instead?

The Zodiac killer draws a radian on the map with the murders in Vallejo and San
Francisco because the radian also identifies Michael O&#8217;Hare. If
you&#8217;re looking directly at the Zodiac killer, and you need to see his
other, secret, face, how far do you have to travel? Obviously, you have to go
180DEG to see the other face. So if the Zodiac killer gives you a clue that is
in angular form, and you subtract that angle from 180DEG, it should tell you
who the Zodiac killer is.

The radian value is most often given as 57.29DEG.&nbsp; However, that angle can
also be expressed in degrees and minutes. I&#8217;m going to truncate the value
at 57DEG 17&#8217;, and subtract it from 180DEG.

The supplement of the radian is 122DEG 43&#8217;. Michael O&#8217;Hare was born
on January 22, 1943--in other words, 1-22-43. Obviously, other people were born
on that date, but the radian clue narrows the list of suspects significantly.

letters left in his alphabet. If you&#8217;ve had enough theory, maybe
it&#8217;s time to put it into practice? We&#8217;re ready for a trip to
Riverside, California, site of his first murder.
