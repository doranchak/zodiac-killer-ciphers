Here&#8217;s where things get a bit complicated. As Michael O&#8217;Hare steps
onstage in Riverside, he carries with him most of the symbolic props he will
use throughout his performance as The Zodiac killer. This chapter is largely an
introduction to those basic Zodiac killer themes.


Cheri Bates was murdered by the Zodiac killer on Sunday, October 30, 1966.

I will detail the significant facts of that event in the following section.

This chapter will then go on to explain:

1. Why she was murdered WHEN she was murdered.

2. What famous literary work he evoked in a poem, and why.

3. How Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s life is DEFINED by the Cheri Bates murder.

4. Why the format of his letters&#8212;such as typing in ALL-CAPS&#8212;is
important.

5. Why a serial killer&#8217;s FIRST murder changes his identity.

6. How an artist can sign his name on the planet&#8212;in invisible ink.

7. Where the Zodiac killer gave us the key to his coding system.

8. How the Zodiac killer left a map at the murder site.

9. What (probably) REALLY happened the night of the murder.

10. Why police made assumptions they shouldn&#8217;t have made.


The murder in Riverside appears, on the surface, to have been simple. It
wasn&#8217;t.

In many ways, it was the most complex murder ever committed.


Riverside Facts

1. Cheri Bates was an 18-year-old student at Riverside City College in
California on the night of Sunday, October 30, 1966.

2. At 6:10pm that evening, a friend of Cheri&#8217;s saw her lime green VW
Beetle go by on the street and waved to her, but Cheri didn&#8217;t wave back.
At 6:15pm, a man from March Air Force Base saw Cheri&#8217;s car drive up an
alley near the RCC library; it was closely followed by another car.

3. Cheri apparently parked her car across the street from the RCC library at 6:
20pm, but she was never seen alive again after the military man saw her. We do
know she was wearing a light-colored blouse and maroon pants at the time of her
death.

4. The RCC library closed at 9pm that night. At approximately 10:30pm, several
witnesses in the area reported hearing a scream.

5. At 6:30am the following morning, Monday, October 31, 1966, Cheri&#8217;s
body was discovered by an RCC janitor who spotted her lying face down in an
alleyway off Terracina Drive. In 1966 the area was a gravel driveway between
derelict houses; it is presently a parking lot.

6. Cheri&#8217;s torso had been stabbed twice in the front and once in the back
by the shoulder blade, and her throat was slashed three times, nearly
decapitating her. The crime scene yielded the following information:

a., Cheri&#8217;s car engine had been disabled, presumably while she was inside
the RCC library;

b., three books on the electoral college were left on the passenger seat of
Cheri&#8217;s car, next to a greasy palm print;

c., a Timex watch, stopped at 12:22, was found ten feet from Cheri&#8217;s
body.

7. Copies of The Confession Letter, postmarked November 29, 1966 were received
by The Riverside Enterprise newspaper and the chief of police.

8. Some months after the murder, a student&#8217;s desk at the RCC library was
found to have been carved with The Desk Poem:

9. In letters postmarked April 30, 1967, two Loose Leaf Binder Notes were
mailed to the recipients of The Confession Letter; a third copy was mailed to
Cheri Bates&#8217;s father, Joseph Bates, at 4195 Via San Jose in Riverside.

ZZ

The third copy, perhaps significantly, said &#8216;She&#8217; rather than
&#8216;Bates&#8217;, and was not in ALL-CAPS format like the other two copies
and The Confession Letter.

Incidentally, since photographs of the Zodiac killer's letters would simply be
a substantiation of my own diplomatic renditions here on the page, and the
typed versions are easier to read, I&#8217;ve chosen to forgo including
photocopies of the letters in most instances in this book. The reader may
easily find such copies elsewhere, including Robert Graysmith&#8217;s book
ZZooddiiaacc and Tom Voigt&#8217;s excellent website _Z_o_d_i_a_c_k_i_l_l_e_r_._c_o_m.


Devil's Night

Let&#8217;s begin our analysis with the date. Cheri Bates was murdered on
October 30. In addition, a scream was heard that night at 10:30. It&#8217;s
almost as if her killer waited until then so he could call attention to the
date: 10-30. And what date would that be?

No, it&#8217;s not Halloween, which is traditionally celebrated on October 31.

What&#8217;s the night BEFORE Halloween called? That&#8217;s
right&#8212;it&#8217;s Devil&#8217;s Night!

On September 27, 1969, after the attack on the couple at Lake Berryessa, the
Zodiac killer walked up the road to Bryan Hartnell&#8217;s Karmann Ghia and
wrote a message on the car door--the sort of thing revelers were likely to do
on Devil&#8217;s Night, leaving graffiti on houses and cars.




So we can be sure, if the dates are supposed to mean anything, that The Devil
figures prominently on his list of symbols. The Devil, incidentally, is
referenced at numerous points throughout The Zodiac Project, for example, the
radian apexed on Mt. Diablo that I talked about in the last chapter.

Incidentally, Devil's Night is also called Hell Night, so any reference to Hell
itself, even without The Devil being present, would also be allusive.


Desk Poem Paraphrase

Let&#8217;s jump ahead to The Desk Poem to expand on my first point.

I believe The Desk Poem is a paraphrase of a famous literary work.

But first, what do I mean by paraphrase? Here&#8217;s an example:

""8877 yyeeaarrss bbeeffoorree ttooddaayy,, mmyy aanncceessttoorrss aarrrriivveedd iinn AAmmeerriiccaa ttoo eessttaabblliisshh aann
eeggaalliittaarriiaann ssoocciieettyy..""

Sound familiar? No? That&#8217;s funny--all I did was change the words!

Otherwise, my version means the same thing as the more familiar:

""FFoouurr ssccoorree aanndd sseevveenn yyeeaarrss aaggoo oouurr ffaatthheerrss bbrroouugghhtt ffoorrtthh oonn tthhiiss ccoonnttiinneenntt aa
nneeww nnaattiioonn,, ccoonncceeiivveedd iinn LLiibbeerrttyy aanndd ddeeddiiccaatteedd ttoo tthhee pprrooppoossiittiioonn tthhaatt aallll mmeenn
aarree ccrreeaatteedd eeqquuaall..""

In other words, you can disguise a familiar quotation just by changing the
wording, and this has been done before on quiz shows like Jeopardy.


Medieval Manuscript

So what literary work is The Desk Poem paraphrasing?

First, let&#8217;s look for a clue in the form.

SSiicckk ooff lliivviinngg//uunnwwiilllliinngg ttoo ddiiee

You have a single upper case letter, the &#8216;S&#8217; of &#8216;Sick&#8217;,
followed by exclusively lower case letters.
Is there a type of manuscript form that this follows?

What about a medieval manuscript, as transcribed by monks in monasteries during
the Dark Ages, with its large first letter followed by lower case? If
we&#8217;re dealing with a medieval poem, which ones come to mind?

BBeeoowwuullff and TThhee CCaanntteerrbbuurryy TTaalleess are medieval--but neither of those is about

DDaannttee&&##88221177;;ss IInnffeerrnnoo?

The Devil&#8217;s literally at the bottom of things in that poem.

Is it possible that The Desk Poem is a paraphrase of TThhee IInnffeerrnnoo?

Opening Quatrains

Let&#8217;s compare the opening quatrains of the two poems:

_TT_hh_ee_ _DD_ee_ss_kk_ _PP_oo_ee_mm _DD_aa_nn_tt_ee_''_ss_ _II_nn_ff_ee_rr_nn_oo

cclleeaann.. IInn aa ddaarrkk wwoooodd..

At first blush, the passages don&#8217;t seem at all similar. But let&#8217;s
look more closely.

What is Dante actually saying in the first four lines?

The Inferno is set in the year 1300, when Dante was 35. The biblical span of
life is three-score-and-ten, or 70 years. So, at 35, Dante was Midway in his
life&#8217;s journey. In fact, The Inferno has often been called--humorously by
scholars--a poem about a mid-life crisis.

So if I&#8217;m saying Dante&#8217;s Inferno is a poem whose events&#8212;a
trip through Hell&#8212;cut the poet&#8217;s life in half, what am I saying
about The Desk Poem? Obviously, I&#8217;m saying the same thing.

ccuutt..
cclleeaann..
iiff rreedd..
cclleeaann..

The Cheri Bates murder, the Zodiac killer is saying, cuts his life CLEAN in
half.


CLEAN

But why repeat the word CLEAN?

Let&#8217;s once again apply alphabet numbers to the word in question.

CC LL EE AA NN
33 ++ 1122 ++ 55 ++ 11 ++ 1144 == 3355

Again, this is a reference to the quatrain it paraphrases. Dante was cutting
his life in half with the events of the poem. He would visit Hell at age 35,
and then presumably live another 35 years. Thus, the two CLEANs, which are
actually two 35s.

ccuutt..
cclleeaann..
iiff rreedd..
cclleeaann..

But what about &#8216;if red&#8217;? I don&#8217;t think &#8216;red&#8217;
refers here to a color. And &#8216;red&#8217; cannot have anything to do with
Cheri Bates, who was NOT wearing a red dress when she was murdered--she was
wearing maroon slacks. I believe &#8216;if red&#8217; means, 'if this is read
properly'.

ccuutt..
cclleeaann..
iiff rreedd..
cclleeaann..

&#8220;If this is read properly, you&#8217;ll see that I&#8217;m cutting my
life CLEAN in half with the murder of Cheri Bates.&#8221; Which also means,
&#8220;I know EXACTLY when I&#8217;m going to die.&#8221;


HELL GATE

We talked about how The Desk Poem is entirely in lower case except for the
first letter. What about the other two messages? Oddly enough, The Confession
Letter is entirely in UPPER CASE. And that is also true of the first two Loose
Leaf Binder Notes.

Why would the Zodiac killer send messages consisting entirely of capital
letters? In The Inferno, when Dante and the poet Virgil reach The Gates of
Hell, they find this inscription:

TTHHRROOUUGGHH MMEE TTHHEE WWAAYY IINNTTOO TTHHEE SSUUFFFFEERRIINNGG CCIITTYY,,

Personally, I don&#8217;t think eternal damnation is the answer to anything,
but then, I&#8217;m also opposed to capital punishment. Speaking of capitals,
notice that the message on the Gates of Hell is entirely upper case. The first
thing you see of Hell is capital letters, so maybe going there IS a form of
capital punishment! The Zodiac killer is taking you on a trip through Hell, so
the first messages from the Zodiac killer are also in capital letters.

Make sense?


Upper Case


Wait a minute. Why does the third LooseLeaf Note, which was addressed to Cheri
Bates's father, Joseph, at their house at 4195 Via San Jose in Riverside, say




Doesn't that break the pattern of UPPER-CASE LETTERING? It does, but the Zodiac
killer gets some things in return for the slight break in pattern:

He gives Joseph Bates the mock-courtesy of saying 'She' rather than 'BATES',
which also makes the implicit point that he knows what her name is. Reporting
on the mailing emphasized the cruelty inherent in sending such a letter to the
victim's father. But more to the point, the Zodiac killer has gone to the
trouble of finding out her address, so that the mailing stresses the importance
of the victim's identity, not just the night of the murder, but in the overall
scheme. This will be revisited at Blue Rock Springs, when he calls three
relatives of Darlene Ferrin less than two hours after her murder. By not using
UPPER CASE LETTERING, he also avoids telling her father that she was destined
(metaphorically) for Hell.


TERRACINA

The closest actual street to where Cheri Bates&#8217;s body was dumped was
Terracina Drive. The reader will learn that there are drawbacks to using street
names to identify oneself, though the Zodiac killer occasionally used street
names to make a point. This particular street name is appropriate within the
Dante&#8217;s Inferno allusion.

TERRACINA can be translated at least a couple of ways:

as &#8220;Little Terrace&#8221;,

or as &#8220;Through Earth (Terra) To China (Cina)&#8221;

The second translation fits here. Dante went down through the Earth until he
reached the bottom of Hell. Dante was unaware, in the 14th century, that the
Earth is a spinning sphere, but if you go straight through the Earth from
Riverside, you&#8217;ll (figuratively) wind up in China.

This also explains why the Zodiac killer will place his two buried victims in
Chinatowns.


Confession Envelope



The Confession Letter envelope was addressed:

DDAAIILLYY EENNTTEERRPPRRIISSEE
RRIIVVEERRSSIIDDEE
CCAALLIIFF
AATTTTNN:: CCRRIIMMEE

Once again, we have ALL CAPS. Which means we know where the letter&#8217;s
coming from, figuratively speaking. The name of the newspaper was
&#8216;Riverside Enterprise&#8217;. As Gareth Penn pointed out, the address
doesn&#8217;t contain the paper&#8217;s street address or post office box
number.

What it does contain, for those of us preoccupied with pi, are circles. Each
&#8216;i&#8217; in the address is dotted with a circle, except for the
&#8216;i&#8217; in &#8216;Calif&#8217;. In fact, the &#8216;i&#8217;s all look
like lollipops! And the colon following &#8216;Attn&#8217; consists of two
circles. In other words, counting up the &#8216;i&#8217;s and adding two for
the colon should normally get you eight circles, but because of the Zodiac
killer&#8217;s intentional failure to dot the &#8216;i&#8217; in
&#8216;Calif&#8217;, it only contains seven.

Dante&#8217;s Inferno presents a vision of Hell consisting of nine descending
circles, each circle featuring the punishment for a particular type of crime.
The type of crime punished in the seventh circle is, you guessed it, murder.
Which is the crime &#8220;taken credit for&#8221; in the letter itself.

Remember, Michael O&#8217;Hare evokes pi because the binary form of pi spells
out his name in digital Morse code. And pi has to do with the behavior of
circles.

So he alludes to a literary work that consists almost entirely of circles.


Ripper Letter

There&#8217;s an interesting historical footnote to all this. The only serial
killer who wrote to the newspapers prior to the Zodiac may have been Jack The
Ripper himself. The authorities in 1888 received a letter containing what was
supposedly a kidney cut from one of his victims (remember, this was a hundred
years before DNA testing) with the return address, &#8216;From Hell&#8217;.

It&#8217;s possible the Zodiac killer was paying tribute to his forebear by
evoking this Hellish return address. The Zodiac killer doesn&#8217;t bother to
continue doing this once he starts writing letters in the Bay Area. He harps on
a theme for several letters or crimes, and then moves on to other ideas, as if
he&#8217;s made his point. This, once again, is what an artist does. Picasso
had his rose period, then his blue period, then his cubist period, and so on .
. . and so does the Zodiac killer.

But he always signs his work.


Riverside Crossroads

The murder of Cheri Bates represents the crossroads of Michael
O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s life. But that&#8217;s true of any killer, because we tend
to view a person differently once he has committed a murder. O. J. Simpson had
one kind of public persona prior to June 12, 1994. After that day, he was put
in a completely different category by most people (usually depending on what
category they put themselves in). On that day, to many of us, he became a
killer. Note that this transformation is particularly striking for serial
killers, who take on their public persona--their super-villain identity--once
they commit their first murder.

With his first murder, David Berkowitz became &#8220;The Son Of Sam&#8221;.

With his first murder, Peter Sutcliffe became &#8220;The Yorkshire
Ripper&#8221;.

With his first murder, Gary Ridgway became &#8220;The Green River
Killer&#8221;.

So when did Michael O&#8217;Hare become &#8220;The Zodiac&#8221;?

He became The Zodiac when he killed Cheri Bates, at the crossroads of his own
life, which was arrived at down the gravel driveway from Terracina Drive on the
RCC campus. So let&#8217;s examine the specific place on Planet Earth where The
Zodiac committed his first murder.


How To Sign Your Name Anywhere

Let&#8217;s assume you&#8217;re about to commit your first murder and you want
to take &#8220;credit&#8221; for your work by signing your name. And
you&#8217;re going to sign on the planet itself, because that&#8217;s your
canvas. How would you do that?



Let me demonstrate by signing my own name to a hypothetical murder. My name is
Raymond Grant, and there&#8217;s a Grant Street in downtown Pittsburgh, so
let&#8217;s say I dump a body on Grant Street. That was easy, but there are a
lot of Grants out there.


Maybe there&#8217;s an intersecting alley off Grant Street called Raymond Way?
So I dump the body at the intersection of Raymond Way and Grant Street.
I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;d be newspaper accounts of the murder which
wouldn&#8217;t take much notice of the intersection itself. In fact, there
might even be TV coverage which showed the spot of the murder, with the camera
panning back to reveal the intersection street sign reading &#8216;Raymond
Grant&#8217;. Even so, it&#8217;s extremely unlikely anyone covering the crime
would assume someone with my name had committed it.

In any case, this would be hard to pull off in the real world. I would have to
find street names corresponding to my identity, and while there really is a
Grant Street in downtown Pittsburgh, there&#8217;s no alley called Raymond Way
that I&#8217;m aware of. But there&#8217;s a more sophisticated way of doing
the same thing. And it&#8217;s relatively foolproof.

Remember the radio telescope scene in CClloossee EEnnccoouunntteerrss OOff TThhee 33rrdd KKiinndd? The
aliens don&#8217;t say, &#8220;Meet us at Devil&#8217;s Tower in
Wyoming.&#8221; They say, &#8220; Meet us at

110044 4444 3300 4400 3366 1100

As the translator points out, those are Earth coordinates! If you&#8217;re
creating designs on the planet, the logical way to sign your name is by using
numbers. It&#8217;s more precise, plus USGS coordinates apply to every spot on
the globe, so you have the entire canvas to play with.

People may object to the idea of a number representing a person, but when money
is exchanged in our society--which after all is the bottom line--we mostly use
numbers, not letters.

We put our state driver&#8217;s licence number on our checks.
The driver&#8217;s licence itself contains our date of birth.
Our tax returns are filed using our social security number.

For most of us, those three sets of digits don&#8217;t change.

117 Degrees, 23 Minutes

Let&#8217;s take a look at the USGS coordinates of the Cheri Bates murder,
which apparently occurred a few yards below Terracina Drive on the campus of
Riverside City College. There are computer programs which provide USGS
coordinates for any address. If you type in 4800 Magnolia in Riverside,
California, the address of RCC, you should get the following coordinates:

111177DDEEGG WWeesstt LLoonnggiittuuddee

2233DDEEGG NNoorrtthh LLaattiittuuddee

If what I&#8217;m saying--about his first murder being a crossroads where the
law-abiding citizen becomes the serial killer--is correct, then this set of
coordinates should represent both the identity of my suspect, Michael
O&#8217;Hare, and that of what he became with the murder, his alter ego, The
Zodiac. Does it? Well, one of Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s permanent personal
numbers is his social security number, which is

111177--3322--22112288

Obviously, 117DEG degrees corresponds to the first three numbers of his SSN.
And Michael O&#8217;Hare, who was born on Friday, January 22, 1943, was 23
years old on October 30, 1966, so

111177DDEEGG&&nnbbsspp;; 2233&&##88221177;; WWeesstt

can also be read as,

&&##88222200;;111177,, aatt aaggee 2233&&##88222211;;

This works as a shorthand identification for Michael O&#8217;Hare in 1966. He
obviously could have used more of his SSN, but then he can&#8217;t make a
reference to his age at the time, and his age is crucial to the whole design
(remember, he&#8217;s cutting his life CLEAN in two).

33 Degrees, 58 Minutes

Let&#8217;s look at the other coordinate.

3333DDEEGG&&nnbbsspp;; 5588&&##88221177;; NNoorrtthh

The reader&#8217;s been very understanding so far, so I&#8217;ll give him some
latitude.

TT HH EE ZZ OO DD II AA CC
2200 ++ 88 ++ 55 == 3333 2266 ++ 1155 ++ 44 ++ 99 ++ 11 ++ 33 == 5588

Again, this is just straightforward alphabet substitution. The USGS coordinates
for the Riverside murder record the change from Michael O&#8217;Hare (117DEG at
age 23) into THE ZODIAC (33-58).

If you look again at his letters, you will note that he never calls himself
&#8216;Zodiac&#8217;, even though Robert Graysmith titled his book that way,
and director David Fincher calls him that throughout his movie. The killer
always calls himself &#8216;The Zodiac&#8217;, as in, &#8220;This is THE Zodiac
speaking.&#8221;

Not so much to indicate that he was the definite article, but because the
latitude in Riverside spells his name that way. For those of you who were
wondering why the Zodiac never actually used his assumed name in Riverside, but
only hinted at it (with the &#8216;Z&#8217; at the bottom of The Loose Leaf
Notes, and with his brief admission in The LA Times Letter) . . . that&#8217;s
why.

His stage name THE ZODIAC was embedded in the venue itself, and he wanted us to
find it.


Alphabet Substitution

By the way, who said the Zodiac killer was using alphabet substitution?

Well . . . I say it. And the Zodiac killer also says it.

After The Confession Letter, which is unsigned (an unsigned confession being as
good as no confession at all), there are two signed messages in Riverside.

The Loose Leaf Notes are signed with a &#8216;Z&#8217;, and The Desk Poem is
signed &#8216;rh&#8217;.

Graysmith speculates that 'rh' means RH Factor, but I think that&#8217;s a Red
Herring.

Most of us go by different versions of our names. My family calls me
&#8216;Raymond&#8217;. My friends call me &#8216;Ray&#8217; (this is beginning
to sound like the old Ace Trucking Company routine). And my bosses at The U. S.
Postal Service call me &#8216;Grant&#8217;. And, obviously, I can sign notes
either &#8216;Ray&#8217; or &#8216;Grant&#8217; or even &#8216;RG&#8217;. And
the people reading them will assume that &#8216;Ray&#8217; is
&#8216;Grant&#8217;.

So let&#8217;s assume the same thing about the Zodiac killer, that

&&##88221166;;ZZ&&##88221177;; iiss &&##88221166;;rrhh&&##88221177;;

And since the Zodiac killer is into math, let&#8217;s convert that statement
into mathematical terms.

ZZ == rrhh

But how can Z possibly equal rh? Why don&#8217;t we try putting alphabet
numbers under the letters?

ZZ == rr hh
2266 == 1188 88

Now it all adds up, doesn&#8217;t it?

2266 == 1188 ++ 88

Correct? So the Zodiac killer was using alphabet numbers to identify himself.
And the letters at the bottom in Riverside weren&#8217;t his initials. They
were a key to his coding system.


Nostradamus

Let&#8217;s go back to The Desk Poem. I said he&#8217;s paraphrasing
DDaannttee&&##88221177;;ss IInnffeerrnnoo, but why in Hell would he do that? Why doesn&#8217;t he
just tell us who he is?

Maybe that&#8217;s exactly what he&#8217;s doing? Remember: he always signs his
name. So if the first four lines of The Desk Poem are an allusion to the
opening stanza of DDaannttee&&##88221177;;ss IInnffeerrnnoo, then there must be something in that
opening stanza that tells us who the Zodiac killer is!

But how could a 14th century poem contain the name of the 20th century&#8217;s
most notorious uncaptured serial killer? Is this another of those books about
Nostradamus?

Not exactly. Let&#8217;s look one more time at the passage he evokes in The
Desk Poem:

MMiiddwwaayy iinn mmyy lliiffee&&##88221177;;ss jjoouurrnneeyy
II ssttrraayyeedd ffrroomm tthhee ssttrraaiigghhtt ppaatthh
AAnndd ffoouunndd mmyysseellff aalloonnee
IInn aa ddaarrkk wwoooodd..

How could that possibly tell you who he is? Well, one thing we know about the
Zodiac killer--he&#8217;s economical. He only killed a handful of people (that
we know about), and his reign of terror, such as it was, lasted just a few
months, and yet his name is more evocative than that of any serial killer of
the past century. If he were going to tell you who he was in a literary
passage, what would be the most direct and economical way of doing that?

How about with the first word?

MMiiddwwaayy

He&#8217;s Midway through his life when he kills Cheri Bates.

But maybe he&#8217;s Midway in some other sense as well?


Midway

The Zodiac killer is Midway through his life in Riverside. And most English
translations of TThhee IInnffeerrnnoobegin with MIDWAY. But what does the word
&#8216;Midway&#8217; mean to us?

Well, it was a famous naval battle during WWII--the Battle of Midway, named for
Midway Island in the Pacific. But that doesn&#8217;t seem to get us anywhere.

Wait--wasn&#8217;t there an airport in Chicago called Midway? That&#8217;s
right, and it was the busiest airport in the world! Midway--which was renamed
in 1949 after The Battle of Midway, was the world&#8217;s busiest airport from
1932 until 1962. But in 1962, the title of World&#8217;s Busiest Airport was
claimed by another, newly built, Chicago airport.

OO&&##88221177;;HHaarree

So, in a sense, the names &#8216;Midway&#8217; and &#8216;O&#8217;Hare&#8217;
are synonyms, both standing for an airport that once was the world&#8217;s
busiest.

When the Zodiac killer says, &#8220; I am Midway.&#8221;, he is also saying,
&#8220; I am O&#8217;Hare.&#8221;


ORD

The 3-letter designation (every airport has one) for O&#8217;Hare airport is

OORRDD

Remember the Zodiac killer&#8217;s &#8220;scorecard&#8221; stat in The Exorcist
Letter of January 29, 1974?

MMee -- 3377

The anagram for ZODIAC (CADOIZ) converts to 3, followed by 7 digits of pi.

Let&#8217;s see what the alphabet numbers are for the O&#8217;Hare airport
code!

OO RR DD
1155 ++ 1188 ++ 44 == 3377

&#8216;ORD&#8217; is just one of many instances where the Zodiac killer says,
implicitly, &#8220; I am pi.&#8221;

Incidentally, I&#8217;ve mentioned that Michael O&#8217;Hare was not alone in
his pursuit of the Zodiac Project, and the letters ORD, converted to Morse
code/binary math, hint at the same thing:

OO RR DD
111111 001100 110000(Morse/binary)

11111100110011 0000
111177 xx44

We recognize 117 as an identifier (SSN) for Michael O&#8217;Hare. I will
demonstrate other examples of the name O&#8217;HARE showing up in the Zodiac
killer lore.

Murder Date

Why did the Zodiac killer pick October 30, 1966 to begin his project?

Besides its being Devil&#8217;s Night?

For example, why not 10/30/67 instead?

The Zodiac literature is partly about dead languages (like Morse code) and
essentially silent languages (like binary math, the language of computers).
Gareth Penn mentions, in Times 17, the death of one Dolly Pentreath on December
26, 1777.



Dolly Pentreath is significant because she was the last native speaker of the
Cornish language; when she died, in a sense, Cornish died with her, at least as
a &#8220;living&#8221; language.

Here&#8217;s a little experiment for the reader to try. Take your calculator
and enter the year 1777.
Then multiply that number by the alphabet letters for ZODIAC:

ZZ OO DD II AA CC
2266 ++ 1155 ++ 44 ++ 99 ++ 11 ++ 33 == 5588

5588 xx 11777777 == ??


Pure Speculation

I don&#8217;t think Cheri Bates ever went into the RCC library. I believe
Michael O&#8217;Hare either accosted her at gunpoint after she parked her car,
or that perhaps Hugh Penn flashed his California Highway Patrol ID as she was
getting out, and got her to go with him. In either case, she was then quickly
gagged and tied up pending her murder later in the evening.

What appeared to happen afterward was essentially staged by The Zodiac Project
personnel. She was obviously selected in advance; she must have been, or her
killer wouldn&#8217;t have disabled her engine. Even though he probably
kidnapped her, he disabled it anyway to make the point that CHERI BATES was the
intended target.

Why do I believe this nonsense? I believe this nonsense because when the
Riverside Police reconstructed the night of the murder two weeks later, on
November 13, 1966, with the full cooperation of all 65 students and staff who
were at the RCC library that night, no one remembered seeing her, even though
RPD dressed a blonde about Cheri&#8217;s build and height in the same outfit
Cheri had been wearing that night, just to remind the participants of what she
would have looked like that evening.

Believing Cheri was in the RCC library for almost three hours means believing
none of her friends saw her. It also means believing she didn&#8217;t see them,
since Cheri Bates seldom did anything without telling at least one of her
friends about it.

Police said two people were unaccounted for at the reconstruction: a bearded
man in his 20s, and a woman. That could easily have been Michael Henry
O&#8217;Hare, aged 23, and his mother, Berta Margoulies, aged 59, that evening.


Electoral College

A greasy palm print and three books on the electoral college were left on the
passenger seat of Cheri Bates&#8217;s lime green VW Beetle. I believe Michael
O&#8217;Hare, and not Cheri Bates, took those books out, using Cheri&#8217;s
library card to do so. Such college ID cards in 1966 were normally hard plastic
with a keypunch code, and did not feature pictures of the student. In the
unlikely event he was challenged, he could have said he was taking books out
for a girl friend.

The telltale clue is to be found in the Library of Congress classification for
the electoral college:

JJKK 552299

The sequence (J, K . . . L) equates the letter L to a squared number, and we
will see a double-L--or squared 12--in The Cryptogram material. The number 529
is 23-squared.

552299 == 223322

Remember, I said that Michael O&#8217;Hare was 23 at the time of the Riverside
murder. That&#8217;s why the longitude reads

111177DDEEGG&&nnbbsspp;; 2233&&##88221177;;

. . . which is meant to be read as &#8216;117 (Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s
SSN) at age 23&#8217;. The Desk Poem states the murder was meant to CUT his
life CLEAN in half, i. e., he would have lived 23 years as Michael
O&#8217;Hare, and then 23 years as The Zodiac. Then his life would come to an
end.

2233 2233

The electoral college Library of Congress classification number--529, or 23-
squared--is just one of many forms of this idea we will find hidden throughout
the Zodiac lore. I will focus on this aspect of The Zodiac Project in the next
chapter. But first, a final thought about &#8216;529&#8217; itself.



Zip Codes

If you look at the zip code for Riverside, you can see the two ends of the
railroad track that is The Zodiac Project in the mirror-image numbers. The zip
code for Riverside City College at 4800 Magnolia is 92506.

_99_22_55_______________________________________55_22_99
((RRiivveerrssiiddee)) ((TTeerrmmiinnuuss))

As Gareth Penn once told me, and as I&#8217;ve already mentioned, the chief
design element of The Zodiac Project is symmetry. What you see in the
beginning, you see at the end.

Another advantage to postal zip codes is that, like SSNs and DOBs, they never
change.

Interestingly, there&#8217;s no postal zip code that begins 529--.
Davenport, Iowa is 528--, and Adell, Wisconsin is 530--.
But 529-- is a place that doesn&#8217;t exist.

Except, perhaps, in The Twilight Zone. And in The Zodiac Project.


Riverside Timex

When Cheri Bates's body was found on Monday morning, October 31, 1966, a Timex
wrist watch with a broken black band, stopped at 12:22, was found ten feet from
the body.

Somehow, an extremely time-conscious killer (The Confession Letter is loaded
with time references) armed with a flashlight (since he had opened the hood of
her car and pulled out the middle wire from the distributor) had had his
timepiece yanked off his wrist in the death struggle with Cheri Bates, and he
hadn't missed it and/or bothered to come back for it.

It makes no sense that such a time-conscious killer would be wearing a watch
that had already stopped, and the watch couldn't have been stopped in the
violence of the attack itself, since the attack occurred around 10:30pm that
night and the watch was stopped at 12:22.

What happened?

Could the watch have been left behind intentionally, as a clue?


71 Degrees

I&#8217;m sure there are viewers of David Fincher&#8217;s ZZooddiiaacc who walked out
thinking, &#8220; I wonder where that guy was coming from?&#8221; Michael
O&#8217;Hare leaves a Timex wrist watch behind in Riverside, among other
reasons, to TELL us where he was coming from. Remember that, geologically
speaking, time is an indicator of space, specified in minutes and seconds.

TT II MM EE XX
2200 ++ 99 ++ 1133 ++ 55 ++ 2244 == 7711

TIMEX is 71 by alphabet numbers. Since we were talking about longitude and
latitude a little while ago, could that number possibly designate an Earth
coordinate?

71DEG North or South Latitude would put us in the polar regions.
It seems unlikely the Zodiac killer came from either the North or South Pole.

71DEG East Longitude puts us in Western India and Pakistan. I realize the
Zodiac killer resorted to his own brand of terrorism, but it's doubtful
he&#8217;s a charter member of Al Qaeda.

That leaves 71DEG West Longitude, a meridian that travels south through Canada
and goes through one major American city before heading out into the Atlantic
Ocean. That city is Boston, Massachusetts, the home town of Michael
O&#8217;Hare through most of the Zodiac killer years. Oddly enough, if you look
at TIMEX another way, you get the same answer.


(617)

Convert TIMEX to digital Morse code (1 for dash, 0 for dot) and you get the
following:

TT II MM EE XX
11 0000 1111 00 11000011 == 661177

617 is the telephone area code for Boston, Massachusetts. Coming from this part
of the country might also explain why the Zodiac killer uses the phrase
&#8216;XMass&#8217; in his second Vallejo letter.

The reader will notice, in future sections, that the Zodiac killer very often
will choose a word or idea that gets the same result, arrived at through two
different decoding methods. This is an echo of The Zodiac Project&#8217;s main
design feature, which is symmetry.


12:22

The Timex watch in Riverside was stopped at 12:22.

Nothing pertaining to Cheri Bates&#8217;s murder happened anywhere near that
time, so it&#8217;s clear that the watch did NOT stop as a result of the Zodiac
killer&#8217;s struggle with his victim.

Timexes aren&#8217;t supposed to stop anyway, for any reason. John Cameron
Swayze strapped them up to fan blades, airplane propellers, and even washing
machine agitators in commercials from the 1950s, and the watch never stopped
once on live TV.

So it&#8217;s reasonable to assume the Zodiac killer stopped the watch and
placed it at the murder scene as a clue. Why?

Again, remember what I said in the previous section. In geological terms, space
is measured in words we usually associate with timekeeping&#8212;minutes and
seconds.

Let's look again at the California/Nevada border. Assume the border represents
a clock face, with the vertical line the hour hand and the horizontal one the
minute hand. What time is it?



The important thing to remember about the Timex is that it gave the wrong time
and the wrong impression. It didn&#8217;t tell us WHEN something HAPPENED.

It told us WHERE something was GOING TO HAPPEN.

On October 30, 1966, the Zodiac left, at the Cheri Bates crime scene, a map of
a future murder. The Timex watch is the map.

It predicts where the murder of Donna Lass will take place on September 6,
1970&#8212;at Lake Tahoe/Stateline, on the California/Nevada border.


9:07

I've been criticized by several Zodiac researchers for suggesting that the
Timex watch in Riverside was, in fact, stopped at 12:22. These researchers
insist, based upon what appears to be a photograph of the watch whose source no
one can identify, that the watch was never actually stopped. This photo of the
watch has it showing a time of 9:07.



The logic goes that, since the watch was photographed at the crime scene and
apparently later at headquarters, and it shows two DIFFERENT times (9:07 and
12:22), the Timex must therefore still have been running when it was found
beside Cheri Bates's body.

There are numerous sources for the information that the watch was stopped at a
time given variously as 12:22, 12:23, and 12:24.

Here's a quote from pages 8-9 of TThhiiss IIss TThhee ZZooddiiaacc SSppeeaakkiinngg (2002), by David

Homicide Detail

I sent an email to the homicide detail of The Riverside Police Department,
asking them to verify as best they could (considering the passage of time)
whether or not the Timex left beside Cheri Bates's body had been stopped at 12:
22 (or 12:23, or some similar time).

I received the following reply to that email:

THE time on THE watch is not of significant value in identifying a suspect.

In other words, the watch was stopped. That couldn't mean anything else.

If the watch was still running, would homicide detectives determine that the
time on the watch was not of significant value in identifying a suspect?

Would detectives even address the issue of the significance of the watch time,
if the watch time was changing every minute?

Let&#8217;s now briefly look at Michael O&#8217;Hare . . . as he was in 1966/
67.


Michael O'Hare 1967

I&#8217;m suggesting a connection between the Zodiac killer and Michael
O&#8217;Hare.

I&#8217;m suggesting they&#8217;re the same person, but with a different face
presented to the world.

But let&#8217;s assume I&#8217;m wrong, and they AREN&#8217;T one and the same.

In 1966/1967, the Zodiac was killing Cheri Bates in Riverside and sending
letters to the newspapers and police. I myself was attending high school, 10th
grade at Taylor Allderdice in Pittsburgh, and completely oblivious to all this.
I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s a lesson in there somewhere.

If the Zodiac killer and Michael O&#8217;Hare lived in separate worlds, it
seems reasonable to assume those worlds would not intersect with one another.
We know what the Zodiac was doing in 1966/1967. But what was Michael
O&#8217;Hare doing in 1966/1967?

It may seem like a long time ago, but there&#8217;s a record of one of Mr.
O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s projects from back then, and it's available at most public
libraries. And unlike the books found on Cheri Bates&#8217;s car seat, a
library card isn&#8217;t necessary to gain access to that material.


WWs

Michael O&#8217;Hare cut his life CLEAN in half with the Cheri Bates murder. He
wanted to spend 23 years (1943-1966) as Michael O&#8217;Hare. Then he wanted to
spend 23 years (1966-1989) as The Zodiac. And then he&#8217;d go out with a
very Big Bang&#8212;about which, more later. But first, let me demonstrate that
this idea of 23 followed by 23 is all over the Zodiac murders and letters.

If you&#8217;re using alphabet letters to substitute for numbers, what letter
do you use to substitute for the number 23? Obviously, you&#8217;d use the 23rd
letter--W. And if you were going to suggest the dichotomy of 23/23, you would
most likely use a double-W, right?

WW WW

The Zodiac killer uses several forms of this idea in its alphabetic form, W/W,
as well as its numeric forms 23/23, 2 x 23, and even 2-23. Let&#8217;s cite
some of the double-Ws:


a. The Timex in Riverside is a WWrriisstt WWaattcchh.

b. The shoeprints at Lake Berryessa are identified as WWiinngg WWaallkkeerrss.

c. In two Cryptogram cover letters, he threatens a rampage covering the WWhhoollee
WWeeeekkeenndd.


But the most ballistic example occurs in the parking lot at Blue Rock Springs.


W-Ws

At Blue Rock Springs, for the first and only time in his career, the Zodiac
killer is profligate in his use of ammo, even to the point of being
&#8220;trigger happy&#8221;.

Let&#8217;s quickly review how economical he&#8217;s been elsewhere:

1. Riverside--3 slashes to the throat and done;

2. Lake Herman Road--one shot to David Faraday&#8217;s temple, five shots in
Betty Lou Jensen&#8217;s upper torso (though he does use four initial shots to
herd them from the car);

3. Lake Berryessa--7 stab wounds to Bryan Hartnell, 10 to Cecelia Ann Shepard .
. . and he never actually fires his .45;

4. Presidio Heights--one shot to the back of Paul Stine&#8217;s head.

But at Blue Rock Springs, he sprays the victims &#8220;as if it was a water
hose&#8221;, even coming back to the victim&#8217;s car for a second go-round.
Why?

Could it possibly be because he was using WWiinncchheesstteerr WWeesstteerrnn ammo at that
venue?

WWiinncchheesstteerr WWeesstteerrnn

WW WW


When the Vallejo detectives examine the shell casings littering the crime
scene, they see that they&#8217;re all marked &#8216;WW--WW&#8217;.

the hardcover edition

The Zodiac killer sprays WW--WWs all over the parking lot at Blue Rock Springs to
emphasize that WW--WW is one of the main themes of the Zodiac murders.


Wind Whistles

Now that I&#8217;ve mentioned it, some of you are probably wondering what
Michael O&#8217;Hare WAS doing around the time of the Riverside murder and its
subsequent events. If you want to see for yourself, and have the unique
experience of witnessing criminal activity frozen in time on the pages of an
academic journal, take a walk down to your local city library. In March 1967,
Michael O&#8217;Hare published his maiden journal article in Progressive
Architecture Magazine:



""WWiinndd WWhhiissttlleess TThhoouugghh MMIITT TToowweerr""

Kind of an odd title for an academic article, isn&#8217;t it?

WWiinndd WWhhiissttlleess

WW WW

Here is Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s first public paper, one might even say his
first public fart (since he's breaking wind), held up for the Whole World to
see, and the first thing out of his mouth is &#8220;W-W&#8221;. The choice of
project is doubly significant, because The MIT Tower was to be one of the
target sites on the last day of The Zodiac Project.


117 Degrees

The diagrams on page 4 of the Progressive Architecture article include a model
of The MIT Tower with a stick or strut leaning against it in such a way as to
produce a 117DEG angle.



The angle has been artificially emphasized by the author&#8217;s having placed
tape at each end of the stick, in such a way as a naturally-occurring shadow
would never have appeared.



He is thus calling our attention to that angle. The angle of the shadow is
117DEG.

The longitude of the spot where Cheri Bates was murdered was 117DEG West.

Among other things, this reminds us that USGS coordinates and geometric angles
use the same language (both are expressed in degrees), and the Zodiac will make
use of this linguistic flexibility elsewhere. 117DEG is a reference to the
Riverside murder, which would have occurred about the same time as the
preparation for this article. One must assume that the author, who could time
his Zodiac killer mailings down to the day, had no direct influence over the
publication date of this article, but he knew it would come out either late in
1966 or early in 1967.


Two 23s

Gareth Penn&#8217;s book, TTiimmeess 1177, mentions the 117DEG angle on the model. But
he fails to point out that, under the picture of the model, the author has also
written the number 23 twice.



So Michael O&#8217;Hare twice makes the same point that the Zodiac killer has
been making, that double-Ws and 23/23 are important clues to his identity.

By the way, if anyone out there has a &#8220;perfectly logical&#8221;
alternative explanation for all this odd behavior on Mr. O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s
part, I&#8217;d certainly like to hear it. We&#8217;re not talking here about
the preoccupations of a crazed serial killer. We&#8217;re talking about a
respected member of the academic community . . . who also happens to be a
serial killer.


DNA

Now is as good a time as any to suggest a thematic reason for dividing
one&#8217;s life into 23-year halves, as opposed, say, to Dante&#8217;s 35.
Dante&#8217;s 35/35 dichotomy is Bible-based, on a life expectancy of 70. So
why would Michael O&#8217;Hare choose 23/23 instead?

Why not 35/35, or, if hindsight is perfect, 20/20?

Because sight isn&#8217;t enough. An artist must also provide in-sight: into
human life, a connection to the general population for his art, otherwise
anything he creates is merely subjective.

Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s life was to be divided into segments of 23/23. But
so, in a matter of speaking, are all our lives. It&#8217;s in our genes.

Every human cell consists of 46 chromosomes.

23 are donated by the mother.

And 23 are donated by the father.

DNA, which is now used to identify perpetrators by crime labs (a form of
progress which probably couldn&#8217;t have been anticipated in 1966),
thematically identifies Michael O&#8217;Hare as the Zodiac killer. His scheme
is literally an example of Art imitating DNA.


O'Hare 1967 Review

This book accuses former Harvard lecturer Michael O&#8217;Hare of being the
Zodiac killer. This chapter makes the case that Michael O&#8217;Hare was
preoccupied with the same things the Zodiac killer was preoccupied with, and at
the same time (1966/67).
