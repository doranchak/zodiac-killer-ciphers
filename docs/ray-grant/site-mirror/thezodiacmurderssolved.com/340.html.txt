340 1

The Pen Card, not coincidentally, contains the Zodiac killer&#8217;s most
notoriously cryptic message, The 340-Character Cipher.

SSoorrrryy II hhaavveenn&&##88221177;;tt wwrriitttteenn bbuutt II jjuusstt wwaasshheedd mmyy ppeenn .. .. ..

The enemy of writing done with a fountain pen is water, which will tend to
erase whatever message was written, leaving only the barest outline. The
suggestion implicit in the card is that he&#8217;s written something and
purposely washed out the message. It&#8217;s almost as if the Zodiac killer is
telling us that we won&#8217;t be able to solve this one, that he made sure the
message was written in invisible ink.

TThhiiss iiss tthhee ZZooddiiaacc ssppeeaakkiinngg

You won&#8217;t get the news for a while because you won&#8217;t be able to
solve The 340. The bad news, by the way, is that he&#8217;s picking his victims
by name.

That&#8217;s why all attempts to solve The 340 have failed.
It&#8217;s not a statement. It&#8217;s a list.

This is also the point of using a commercial greeting card. A commercial
message is one that we have to watch if we&#8217;re going to be able to see the
rest of the show. So the commercial greeting card is a hint that the Zodiac
killer is telling us something not so much to entertain us as to get his own
message out&#8212;his own advertisement, as it were.

The 340-Character Cipher is a message he doesn&#8217;t want us to solve.
But he&#8217;s putting it out there to prove a point.

He&#8217;s picking his victims in advance&#8212;by name.


340 2

Remember, I&#8217;ve been saying all along that the Zodiac killer chose his
victims, at least nominally, in advance. I didn&#8217;t say just how FAR in
advance, but the answer to that is, in at least one case I&#8217;m about to
demonstrate, 12 years and 20 days.

And that&#8217;s just figuring from the date The 340 was mailed.
Obviously, he chose all his victims from the outset.

This assumption makes further sense considering the Zodiac killer&#8217;s
&#8220;Mikado Letter&#8221; of July 25, 1970, where he paraphrased the patter-
song from Gilbert & Sullivan&#8217;s Mikado with its refrain, sung by Ko-Ko,
The Lord High Executioner:

AAss ssoommee ddaayy iitt mmaayy hhaappppeenn tthhaatt aa vviiccttiimm mmuusstt bbee ffoouunndd,,
II''vvee ggoott aa lliittttllee lliisstt &&##88221122;; II''vvee ggoott aa lliittttllee lliisstt

Note, by the way, that &#8220;little list&#8221; is another acrostic of LL,
which stands for 1-22. I don&#8217;t see how the Zodiac killer could make a
more blatant reference to what he was doing in The 340-Character Cipher than to
quote that song.

And it also makes sense that if he had a list, he&#8217;d show it to us.

You can solve a coded statement because it will have words you&#8217;re looking
for. The Hardens looked for the word KILL in The Cryptogram and found it all
over the place.

But you can&#8217;t solve a coded list unless you know what names are included.

I don&#8217;t know that the Zodiac killer picked specific individuals in
advance.
I do know that he intended to kill victims who had specific names.

This is what TThhee TTeerrmmiinnaattoorr robot does in the original movie. He knows
he&#8217;s after a woman named &#8216;Sarah Connor&#8217;, and he knows she
lives in LA. So he goes to LA, finds every &#8216;Sarah Connor&#8217; in the
phone book, and goes to each listed residence and kills that Sarah Connor.
Sooner or later, he&#8217;s going to get the right one.

That&#8217;s basically what the Zodiac killer was doing, and The 340 proves it.

The 340 is a list of the names of Zodiac victims.


340 3

Let&#8217;s start with basic assumptions. I said, in Chapter G, that the 18
letters at the end of The Cryptogram are a blatant indication that The
Cryptogram is a two-step cipher.

The same is also true of The 340.
In fact, all four Zodiac ciphers are two-step ciphers.
Not only that, all four Zodiac ciphers use the same symbol values.

That&#8217;s right. It&#8217;s one of the great cryptographic punchlines of all
time, but all four Zodiac ciphers are meant to be solved using the same
character-values, even though doing that doesn&#8217;t seem to lead to a
solution.

In his &#8220;This Is The Zodiac Speaking&#8221; Letter of August 4, 1969, the
Zodiac killer is curious about one thing:

BByy tthhee wwaayy,, aarree tthhee ppoolliiccee
hhaavviinngg aa ggoooodd ttiimmee wwiitthh tthhee
ccooddee?? IIff nnoott,, tteellll tthheemm ttoo cchheeeerr
uupp;; wwhheenn tthheeyy ddoo ccrraacckk iitt
tthheeyy wwiillll hhaavvee mmee..

Essentially, the Zodiac killer is telling police that he&#8217;s using the same
symbol-values for all his ciphers, because he refers to his handiwork as a
&#8216;code&#8217;. Remember, a cipher is an individually-encrypted document. A
code is a general mode of encipherment (like alphabet numbers).

Thus, we need to take a second look at The Cryptogram symbol-values, as applied
to The 340.


Cryptogram Values

19 - S I O E - I R L Y U N L - - - V
20 - H N T E E I A D E N ? W - S - E

Again, all I&#8217;ve done here is assume the symbols used in The 340 stand for
the same letters they stand for in The Cryptogram. The ? in the grid stands for
the symbol in The Cryptogram that stood for either A or S, whichever made sense
in the statement. Since there&#8217;s no statement coming out of The 340,
we&#8217;ll never know which letter was intended.

The dashes stand for new symbols which were not part of The Cryptogram.

Note that it may still be possible, given the content of The 340 (though we
know it&#8217;s not a statement), to figure out what those new symbols mean.

Logically, to be able to do this, we&#8217;d have to recognize parts of the
solution.
Let me give an example of this idea, using my own name:

AAYYMMOONNDD GGRRAANN

If you know there&#8217;s a list of names there, and you see this much of my
name, you would assume the initial R and the final T, right?

The Zodiac ciphers are less about cryptography and more about &#8220;decoder-
ring&#8221; types of secret writing, but any analysis of The 340 is going to
seem pretty dense to the public, so I&#8217;m going to limit my discussion here
to two passages.

In Row 10, Columns 2-12, we find DDAAIIBBEENNFFEENNEE((??)).

In Row 18, Columns 6-17, we find DDEEVVIINNAATTOOKKNN.

Both these expressions contain the names of Zodiac victims.

I&#8217;ll begin with DDAAIIBBEENNFFEENNEE((??)).

Let&#8217;s convert DDAAIIBBEENNFFEENNEE((??)) to Morse/binary:

DD AA II BB EE NN FF EE NN EE ??

This 23-digit expression converts to an overlapping form of the Vallejo
driver&#8217;s names, like so:

DD AA II BB EE NN FF EE NN EE ??

This tells you that the symbol in Row 10, Column 1 (-) stands for B (1000).

DD FF EE RR RR II NN

This also tells you that the dotted triangle (Row 10, Column 12) stands for A
and not S, and is followed by a letter leading with a Morse dot.

DDAAVVIIDD FF
DD FFEERRRRIINN

The linked Vallejo victims are linked in The 340. Keep in mind that this form
is particularly appropriate because Darlene Ferrin&#8217;s nickname was
&#8216;Dee&#8217;.

Both forms use the part of the names that contain the word EASTER.



Linking Form


DDAAVVIIDD FF
DD FFEERRRRIINN

Why would the Zodiac killer put the names of two victims he had already killed
in The 340?

After all, David Faraday died on December 20, 1968.
And Darlene Ferrin died July 5, 1969.

The 340 was sent to The San Francisco Chronicle on November 8, 1969.

If the Zodiac killer is trying to &#8220;scoop&#8221; the world by announcing
murders that he hasn&#8217;t yet committed, why mention these two at all?

First, because if he doesn't use the names of victims that are already familiar
to us, we won't recognize that The 340 is a list of victims. So he has to
include past victims on the list.

Second, because he has to give us a key to deciphering the unknown symbol-
values, and we can only do that if we can look at the names like a crossword
puzzle and figure out missing letters from what's already there. I know some
readers are going to object to my assuming the first 1 1/2 letters of DAVID's
name, and the last letter of FERRIN, in this linking form, but it's the
cryptographic equivalent of hinting at the solution, and there's no way around
it.

Plus, he doesn&#8217;t know that we&#8217;ve already linked the Vallejo
drivers.

Obviously, this book didn&#8217;t exist in November 1969. And, by the time of
The Pen Card, no one (and certainly not the police or newspapers) had noticed
that David Faraday and Darlene Ferrin had the same initials, and that their
initials were a clue as to the theme of the Zodiac&#8217;s murders.

And he&#8217;s showing us, in this linking form, that they ARE connected.

Remember what the Zodiac killer says in Riverside:

BBAATTEESS HHAADD TTOO DDIIEE
TTHHEERREE WWIILLLL BBEE MMOORREE

Cheri Bates had to die because her name means &#8216;Virgin Death&#8217;. When
the Zodiac killer says THERE WILL BE MORE, he doesn&#8217;t just mean there
will be more victims. He means, There will be more victims whose names mark
them for death, and who, therefore, have to die.

Now let&#8217;s look at Passage #2.

In Row 18, Columns 6-15, we find DEVINATOKN.

Note that, once again, we have a 23-digit string. With the DAIBENFENE sequence
on Line 10, we thus have two 23-digit strings representing the names of Zodiac
victims&#8212;another form of 2/23. How does this sequence convert to Joan
Webster&#8217;s name?

Again, he leaves off the leading letters W-E so that we know what the preceding
symbol stands for&#8212;in this case, the letter P.


BSTER, JOAN

Keep in mind that we started with a passage in Row 18, consisting of The
Cryptogram values for the symbols in The 340.

Those 23 digits convert to the name WEBSTER, JOAN, save for the first two
letters.

00111111 111111 0011 1100 001111 00 11000000 000000 11 00 001100

. . . the first letter of the second step (The Cryptogram values) would have to
remain &#8216;J&#8217;, because it&#8217;s a four-digit letter. By leading with
her last name, he can use a four-digit letter that converts to a 3- (W) and a
1-digit (E) letter.

PP
00111100

001111 00
WW EE

This may seem trivial, but cryptographically, it&#8217;s significant.

The 5th symbol of Row 18 of The 340 is &#8216;C&#8217;. If that converts to
&#8216;P&#8217;, and all the ciphers use the same code, then The 32-Character
Cipher (June 26, 1970) leads off with the letters P-I.

The Zodiac killer says, in that letter, that the map coupled with The 32-
Character Cipher will tell people where &#8220;the bomb is set&#8221;. Since
the map itself refers to The Mt. Diablo Radian, and a radian is a circle
divided by 2pi, a code whose solution begins with P-I would seem to suggest
we&#8217;re on the right track.



Galileo

Gareth Penn mentions, in TTiimmeess 1177, that Galileo would publish his astronomical
discoveries in code, using anagrams, so that he could stake his claim to them
while he was waiting for observational proof. In other words, one doesn&#8217;t
always publish codes because he wants those codes to be solved. Sometimes
people put out coded material in order to be able to prove something later on.

Joan Webster&#8217;s name is in The 340-Character Cipher. The 340 was sent to
The San Francisco Chronicle on November 8, 1969. Joan Webster would not be
abducted and murdered until November 28, 1981, in Boston, 12 years and 20 days
later.

Note that both DAIBENFENE and DEVINATOKN are 23-digit strings.

The presence of the two suggests the expression 2/23.

In previous editions of this book, I&#8217;ve called The 340 a list of victims:
past, present, and future. And it&#8217;s true that you can find forms of the
names of other victims inside The 340. But those occurrences may have been
cryptographically unavoidable.

Because the appearance of two 23-digit strings strongly hints that those are
the ONLY important bits of information to be found inside the cipher. So
it&#8217;s quite possible that DAVID F, D FERRIN, and WEBSTER, JOAN are the
only names intentionally present in The 340.

That would take the idea of a Little List about as far as you could take it.


Killed 7 People

The Zodiac killer says, in the next letter, mailed November 9, 1969, that

uupp ttoo tthhee eenndd ooff OOcctt II hhaavvee
kkiilllleedd 77 ppeeooppllee..


Note that, if you go by my count, this is literally true. By midnight on the
31st October, 1969, the Zodiac killer had killed seven:


11.. CChheerrii BBaatteess ((OOccttoobbeerr 3300,, 11996666))

As lawyers like to say, Asked and Answered.

Let&#8217;s look at something else he says in the November 9, 1969 letter.



Entirle Different

The Zodiac killer also says,

II llooookk lliikkee tthhee ddeessccrriippttiioonn

In one of my favorite mystery novels, TThhee 3399 SStteeppss, John Buchan writes

A fool tries to look different.
A clever man looks the same and is different.

I&#8217;m sure Michael O&#8217;Hare didn&#8217;t look any different when he was
killing people than he looks when he&#8217;s lecturing on public policy. Maybe
he was more casually dressed, but that&#8217;s about it.

The Zodiac killer spends part of this letter laughing at SFPD for failing to
spot him on Jackson Street, but as Donald Fouke has pointed out, the crime took
place in "an affluent neighborhood".

In fact, Professor Michael O&#8217;Hare must have looked like he belonged
there.



Signature Phrase

Okay, The 340&#8217;s a hard one. So here&#8217;s an easy one:

What&#8217;s the Zodiac killer&#8217;s signature phrase?

If you ask most &#8220;Zodiologists&#8221;, they&#8217;d be happy to tell you:

TThhiiss iiss tthhee ZZooddiiaacc ssppeeaakkiinngg..

After all, the Zodiac killer says &#8216;This is the Zodiac speaking.&#8217;
eleven times:

1. The &#8220;This Is The Zodiac Speaking&#8221; Letter August 4, 1969
2. The School Bus Threat Letter October 13,1969
3. The Oakland PD Phone Call October 22, 1969
4. The Pen Card November 8, 1969
5. The Bus Bomb Diagram Letter November 9, 1969
6. The Dear Melvin Letter December 20, 1969
7. The 13-Character Cipher Letter April 20, 1970
8. The Mt. Diablo Letter June 26, 1970
9. The Kidnapping Confirmation Letter July 24, 1970
10. The Mikado Letter July 25, 1970
11. The LA Times Letter March 15, 1971

That&#8217;s a lot. But he says something else even more often.


Please Rush To Editor

The Zodiac killer says one phrase more often than . . .

TThhiiss iiss tthhee ZZooddiiaacc ssppeeaakkiinngg..

. . . which he says 11 times.

He says . . .

PPlleeaassee RRuusshh TToo EEddiittoorr

. . . at least 14 times.

Let&#8217;s count them:

The Cryptogram Envelope (Vallejo Times-Herald) 7/31/69 2 times
The Cryptogram Envelope (SF Examiner) 7/31/69 2 times
The Cryptogram Envelope (SF Chronicle) 7/31/69 2 times
The School Bus Threat 10/13/69 2 times
The Pen Card 11/8/69 2 times
The Bus Bomb Diagram Letter 11/9/69 2 times

The LA Times Letter 3/15/71 Once
_T_h_e_ _E_x_o_r_c_i_s_t_ _L_e_t_t_e_r_ _1_/_2_9_/_7_4_ _+_ _O_n_c_e
= 14 times

He may also have used the phrase on The &#8220;This Is The Zodiac
Speaking&#8221; Letter envelope of August 4, 1969, but no photos of that have
been published. In any case, it&#8217;s fair to say that

PPlleeaassee RRuusshh TToo EEddiittoorr

. . . is really the Zodiac killer&#8217;s signature phrase.

Since we know that the Zodiac killer packs every utterance with information, we
can be sure that

PPlleeaassee RRuusshh TToo EEddiittoorr

. . . is perhaps the most significant Zodiac statement of all.


Significant Information

If you wanted to impart the most significant identifying information about
yourself that you possibly could, what would that be?

I&#8217;ve mentioned that the Zodiac killer harps on his date of birth (January
22, 1943), but there are still lots of people that that would include. Two
people born on the same day are said to be Exact Contemporaries. Perhaps the
most amazing coincidence involving exact contemporaries involved the actors
Meredith Baxter Birney and Michael Gross, who were the leads on the NBC sit-com
FFaammiillyy TTiieess, and were also born on the same day, June 21, 1947. My own exact
contemporaries (for April 29, 1951) include Rick Burleson, the Red Sox
shortstop, and the late Nascar superstar Dale Earnhardt.

What about DNA? Even if you had the Zodiac killer&#8217;s DNA (which I believe
he left at the Cheri Bates murder site&#8212;hair was found stuck by blood to
the victim&#8217;s palms) and someone to compare it to, that wouldn&#8217;t
necessarily narrow it down to one person, because the suspect could have an
identical twin who would have the same DNA.

There&#8217;s only one piece of information that identifies a person, to the
exclusion of everyone else.

His social security number.

I work for the federal government, and that&#8217;s what the United States of
America uses to differentiate between its employees.

Since I&#8217;m saying that Michael O&#8217;Hare is the Zodiac killer, and we
know that his social security number is . . .

111177--3322--22112288

. . . and the Zodiac killer&#8217;s signature phrase is . . .

PPlleeaassee RRuusshh TToo EEddiittoorr (almost always said twice)

. . . I must, then, in mathematical terms, be saying that . . .

111177--3322--22112288 == PPlleeaassee RRuusshh TToo EEddiittoorr ((xx22))

That may not seem possible. But that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m saying.

The Zodiac killer uses the phrase PLEASE RUSH TO EDITOR so many times because
it specifically identifies him. It&#8217;s his social security number.


Please Rush


111177--3322--22112288 == PPlleeaassee RRuusshh TToo EEddiittoorr ((xx22))

Okay, let&#8217;s start the translation. But first, keep in mind that the
Zodiac killer uses the phrase twice on the envelopes of his first six Bay Area
letters (not counting August 1969 which we have no photo of). So let&#8217;s
modify the equation to reflect that.

111177--3322--22112288 == PPlleeaassee RRuusshh TToo EEddiittoorr
PPlleeaassee RRuusshh TToo EEddiittoorr

Again, we always start conversions from letter-to-number by using alphabet
numbers, so we&#8217;ll do that here.

PP LL EE AA SS EERR UU SS HH
1166 ++ 1122 ++ 55 ++ 11 ++ 1199 ++ 55 == 55881188 ++ 2211 ++ 1199 ++ 88 == 6666

TT OOEE DD II TT OO RR
2200 ++ 1155 == 335555 ++ 44 ++ 99 ++ 2200 ++ 1155 ++ 1188 == 7711

To repeat, the alphabet values for the phrase are

PPlleeaassee ((5588)) RRuusshh ((6666)) TToo ((3355)) EEddiittoorr ((7711))

Since the phrase is repeated twice, that would seem to indicate we should
double the number values, right? Let&#8217;s start by doubling the first two
words.

111177--3322--22112288 == PPlleeaassee ((5588)) RRuusshh ((6666))
PPlleeaassee ((5588)) RRuusshh ((6666))

55886666
_++_55_88_66_66
1111773322

We&#8217;re already 5 digits into the 9-digit SSN, and we&#8217;ve got a match
so far!

That would seem to indicate we&#8217;re on the right track.


To Editor

So far, so good. We&#8217;ve converted the first half of the phrase PLEASE RUSH
TO EDITOR, the words PLEASE RUSH, to the first five digits of Michael
O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s SSN.

111177--3322--22112288 == PPlleeaassee ((5588)) RRuusshh ((6666))
PPlleeaassee ((5588)) RRuusshh ((6666))

55886666
_++_55_88_66_66
1111773322


Here&#8217;s where it gets tricky. To do exactly the same thing with the
remainder of the SSN, we would need somehow to convert half of 2128 (since we
have to double the phrase to get the result) to letters, and that&#8217;s not
practical here.

22112288 // 22 ==&&nnbbsspp;; 11006644

1100 6644

To convert a word or letter to the number 10, we would have to use the letter
J, or some combination that adds up to ten.

PPlleeaassee RRuusshh JJ
PPlleeaassee RRuusshh AAhhaa!!

Aha! Well, you get the idea.
And you&#8217;d still have to find a fourth word equal to 64.
Instead of doing that, he simply has us add the last two word values.

111177--3322--22112288 == PPlleeaassee RRuusshh ((1111773322)) TToo ((3355)) EEddiittoorr ((7711))

3355 ++ 7711 == 110066

_++_11_00_66
 221122

111177--3322--22112288 == 1111773322 221122 ((88))

I&#8217;ll admit there&#8217;s really no &#8216;8&#8217; on the end, but the
right side is 8 digits, so that number may suggest itself. In any case, with
eight digits of a SSN, he&#8217;s narrowed down the list of possible suspects
to twenty people, at most.



2 Editor

I&#8217;ve said that the principle design element of The Zodiac Project is
symmetry. He always, or nearly always, provides at least two ways that a result
can be arrived at. So, if you don&#8217;t like the idea of adding those last
two words together and then doubling them to get the next three numbers of his
SSN (212), try this.

111177--3322--22112288 == PPlleeaassee RRuusshh ((1111773322)) TToo EEddiittoorr

First, read the word TO simply as a dash or a colon.

PPlleeaassee RRuusshh ((1111773322)) -- EEddiittoorr

Then, read the word EDITOR in Morse/binary instead of alphabet numbers.

EE DD II TT OO RR
00 110000 0000 11 111111 001100 == 22117700

Since both sides of the equation (binary and base-ten) have trailing zeroes,
drop them on each side. There&#8217;s no logic to this, of course, but Gareth
Penn makes such a point about trailing zeroes in binary not being significant,
because they&#8217;re just two-multipliers, I can almost justify this with a
straight face. Now you have

PPlleeaassee RRuusshh ((1111773322)) --EE DD II TT OO RR
00 110000 0000 11 111111 0011-00 == 221177-00

PPlleeaassee RRuusshh ((1111773322)) --EEDDIITTOORR
221177

Now read &#8216;217&#8217; as 21, 7.

PPlleeaassee RRuusshh ((1111773322)) --EEDDIITTOORR
2211,,77

In other words, it&#8217;s 2 to the 1st power, followed by 2 to the 7th power.
That&#8217;s 2, and then 128, or 2128.

PPlleeaassee RRuusshh ((1111773322)) --EEDDIITTOORR
22112288


111177--3322--22112288 == PPlleeaassee RRuusshh ((1111773322)) &&##88221111;; EEddiittoorr ((22112288))

I&#8217;ll freely admit we&#8217;ve left algebraic reasoning behind us, far
behind us. But you can get to the last four digits this way, and it&#8217;s not
dissimilar to &#8220;fudging&#8221; the Zodiac killer has done elsewhere.

There are at least two ways to arrive at Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s SSN,
starting with PLEASE RUSH TO EDITOR. But could it just be a coincidence?

That you can take the Zodiac killer's signature phrase, doubled on the
envelopes of six of his earliest letters, and double the alphabet numbers for
the first two words, and thereby get the first five digits of Michael O'Hare's
SSN . . . no, I don't think that's a coincidence.



Dear Melvin

Robert Graysmith almost gets it right in the Zodiac movie. The Dear Melvin
Letter (December 20, 1969) gives us the Zodiac killer&#8217;s birth date.
He&#8217;s just wrong about the date itself.

First, the Zodiac killer calls attention to the date by mailing a letter
exactly one year following The Lake Herman Road murders. On the car door at
Lake Berryessa, he suggests reading dates as linear expressions, so we&#8217;ll
do that here.

DDeecceemmbbeerr 2200,, 11996688

1122 2200 6688

Note that the first three numbers are a version of January 22nd.

122

The last two numbers are a self-identifier. The statement is meant to read,
&#8220;122 (am) I.&#8221;

Note, first, that &#8216;I&#8217; is the 9th letter of the alphabet. So
we&#8217;ll apply Morse/binary numbers to NINE and see what we get.

NN II NN EE
1100 0000 1100 00 == 6688

112222 00 6688

""JJaannuuaarryy 2222nndd ((aamm)) II..""


December 26, 1980

As long as we&#8217;re discussing 12-20-68, note that Gareth Penn claims to
have discovered the Zodiac&#8217;s radian on the evening of December 26, 1980.

Although his first murder is in Riverside, the killer&#8217;s public identity
as The Zodiac begins on December 20, 1968 with The Lake Herman Road murders. In
like manner, Gareth Penn&#8217;s career as a public accuser of Michael
O&#8217;Hare as the Zodiac begins on December 26, 1980.

Note that those two dates consist of the same numbers.

DDeecceemmbbeerr 2200,, 11996688 DDeecceemmbbeerr 2266,, 11998800

1122--2200--6688 1122--2266--8800

112222006688 112222668800

Odd, isn&#8217;t it? The only difference between the two sequences is the
placement of the zero. It&#8217;s almost as if Gareth were presenting himself
as another manifestation of the Zodiac killer, taking a slightly different
form! I will cite other examples of his doing this when we come to them.



November December Review

Again, we&#8217;re reviewing three Zodiac killer events&#8212;The Pen Card (11-
8-69), The Bus Bomb Diagram Letter (11-9-69), and The Dear Melvin Letter (12-
