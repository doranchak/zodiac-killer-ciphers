<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">It
stands to reason that if you&#8217;re a killer who picks certain victims by
name, and by their appropriateness within your overall scheme, then most
people will have to be eliminated as candidates for murder.<br />
<br />
If you&#8217;ve constructed a puzzle that juggles identity, topographic
locations, ways of measuring time and space, cultural allusions, and any
number of other themes, then, most of the time, you&#8217;re going to pass on
potential victims who are unsuitable because their names are wrong, or
their identities don&#8217;t fit, or the location doesn&#8217;t mesh with the
pattern, or the timing&#8217;s wrong.<br />
<br />
Or all of the above.<br />
<br />
And since it&#8217;s a puzzle, you would have to, at some point, suggest to the public what those eligibility boundaries are.<br />
<br />
If you wanted to demonstrate all your various parameters, you would
probably pick a victim who was inappropriate IN EVERY POSSIBLE WAY.<br />
<br />
And then, to top everything off, you would behave in such a way as to almost not be recognizable yourself, right?<br />
<br />
Where you&#8217;d murdered your other victims quickly . . . this time you&#8217;d hesitate.<br />
<br />
Where you'd barely been visible long enough to make an impression, or
worn a hood, this time you'd be sitting next to your victim for hours.<br />
<br />
Where you'd been quiet or silent, this time you'd be motor-mouthed.<br />
<br />
The downside of doing this would be that you&#8217;d have a Zodiac event and no murder!<br />
<br />
The upside of doing it would be that you would have a living witness
following the event, and therefore you could show that witness aspects
of your previous crimes that might otherwise have escaped the attention
of police and public.<br />
<br />
For example, that you&#8217;d abducted some previous victims before killing them.<br />
<br />
That the Kathleen Johns kidnapping was longer in time than all the other
Zodiac killer events put together should suggest how tight his focus
was elsewhere.</font><font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Kathleen Johns Facts</font></font></font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />
<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Late Sunday evening, March 22, 1970, a 7-months-pregnant woman named
Kathleen Johns was driving her car near Modesto, California when a
passing motorist signaled that there was something the matter with her
car.&nbsp; She pulled over, and the man stopped and said her left rear wheel
was loose.&nbsp; He offered to tighten her lugs.&nbsp; After he did, she started
driving again and the tire he had worked on rolled off the car and spun
into weeds at the side of the road.&nbsp; Saying the trouble was worse than
he thought, the man offered to give her a ride to the nearest service
station.&nbsp; Kathleen got into the car with her 10-month-old infant child.&nbsp;
When they got to the next service station. the man merely drove by.&nbsp;
She asked if he always went around helping people like this.<br />
<br />
The man said, &#8220; When I&#8217;m through with them they don&#8217;t need any help.&#8221;&nbsp;
Then the man began saying, &#8220; You know I&#8217;m going to kill you.&nbsp; You know
you&#8217;re going to die.&#8221;&nbsp; They rode around like that for about 3 hours, and
Kathleen finally got the nerve to jump out of the car when the man
threatened to throw her baby out the window.&nbsp; Some time later, Kathleen
was taken to a local sheriff&#8217;s office and happened to see the Zodiac
killer WANTED poster on the wall.<br />
<br />
&#8220; That&#8217;s HIM,&#8221; she told the officer.&nbsp; &#8220; That&#8217;s the man who kidnapped me!&#8221;<br />
<br />
Police officers looking for Kathleen&#8217;s car found that her abductor had
driven back to it, put the wheel back on, driven the car to the
intersection of Highway 132 and Bird Road, and then set fire to it,
gutting the car.<br />
<br />
In the movie <b>Zodiac</b>, David Fincher has Paul Avery, played by
Robert Downey, Jr., doubt that the Zodiac killer committed the
kidnapping, suggesting instead that he merely took credit for it
afterward.&nbsp; This, if you think about it, is absurd.<br />
<br />
You have the amazing coincidence of Kathleen Johns seeing the WANTED
poster and immediately identifying the Zodiac killer as her abductor,
and then the Zodiac killer himself claiming her as a victim a few months
later, for a crime the bizarre nature of which has &#8216;Zodiac&#8217; written all
over it.&nbsp; I say there&#8217;s no doubt the Zodiac killer kidnapped Kathleen
Johns.<br />
<br />
So how did she survive in one piece, and with her baby unmolested, when
everyone else he encountered either ended up dead or scarred for life?<br />

</div>
<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">I&#8217;ve said that the Zodiac victims were killed because certain aspects of
their identities&#8212;primarily their names, but also their ability to be
designated as virgins (at least nominally), their locations on the map,
and even their posittions in time itself&#8212;were appropriate within the
themes of The Zodiac Project.&nbsp; If certain victims were appropriate, it
stands to reason that certain other potential victims would have been
inappropriate.&nbsp; The Kathleen Johns episode was a public demonstration of
conditions under which he COULDN&#8217;T kill.<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><br />

<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><br />
<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Note the date that the kidnapping was initiated: Sunday, March 22nd.<br />
<br />
March 22nd is 3-22.<br />
<br />
One of the overall themes of The Zodiac Project is 2/23, or 2-23.<br />
<br />
But 322 is the reverse, or opposite of 223.<br />
<br />
Thus, the Zodiac killer abducts a potential victim on "322", and he CAN&#8217;T kill her.<br />
<br />
He drives Kathleen Johns around for three hours to demonstrate this.<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><br />

<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">If you were trying to show that you only kill virgins, or people who
could somehow be associated with a word that means &#8216;virgin&#8217;, how would
you make a public demonstration of that?<br />
<br />
What sort of person would you choose NOT to kill?<br />
<br />
Might you pick a woman who was 7 months pregnant?<br />
<br />
And carrying with her a 10-month-old child?<br />
<br />
In other words, someone who not only WASN&#8217;T a virgin, but was DOUBLY Not A Virgin (thus obeying the law of symmetry)?<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><br />

<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Finally, note what the Zodiac killer does to her car.&nbsp; He drives all the
way back to it, puts the wheel back on, drives it to another location,
and then sets fire to it!<br />
<br />
This takes place at the intersection of Highway 132 and Bird Road.<br />
<br />
Let&#8217;s look at the Morse/binary numbers for FIRE.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; F&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; R&nbsp; E<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0010 00 010 0 = 132</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(Morse/binary math)<br />
<br />
The word FIRE converts to the number 132.&nbsp; So he parks Kathleen Johns&#8217;s
car at Highway 132 and Bird Road to create the phrase FIRE BIRD.&nbsp; To
underscore this, he sets fire to the car.<br />
<br />
Another blazing example of symmetry!<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><br />

<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">As I mention in Chapter H, he sets fire to a car to anticipate his own
Death &amp; Rebirth as the Zodiac killer on August 11, 1989.&nbsp; With his
death will come immortality, and the realization by the world that he
selected his victims ahead of time.<br />
<br />
The Egyptian Phoenix&#8212;The Fire Bird&#8212;rose from its own ashes.<br />
<br />
It was a symbol based upon sunrise, which follows sunset and the night.<br />
<br />
The torching of the Johns vehicle at Highway 132 and Bird Road was in
anticipation of the events of August 11, 1989.&nbsp; It was a physical
manifestation of his own Death and Rebirth.<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><br />

<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">The Johns abduction may also be a demonstration of something else.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ve already said that I don&#8217;t believe Cheri Bates ever went into The
RCC Library the night she was murdered.&nbsp; I believe it was important for
the Zodiac killer to have complete control of the situation, which meant
he probably abducted her at gunpoint the moment she got out of her
car.&nbsp; This allowed him to put her body where he needed it to be, and to
go into the library &amp; take out the books on The Electoral College.<br />
<br />
I also believe the two teenagers at Lake Herman Road may have been
abducted prior to their trip out to the turn-off.&nbsp; They told friends
they were going to an event at the high school, but somehow they ended
up out there in the pitch darkness . . . on what was supposedly their
first date, having not gone anywhere else first except the drive-in
diner.<br />
<br />
It is easier to abduct people and place them on the landscape than a lot
of people might believe, particularly when you have the California
motor vehicles and driver's license data bases at your disposal, and
particularly when no one lives to tell about it.<br />
<br />
I can think of three immediate objections to this line of thinking:<br />
<br />
a, what if something went wrong during the kidnapping and one of the victims got away?;<br />
<br />
b, if he kidnapped Faraday and Jensen, and could place them EXACTLY, why
wouldn't their car be closer to the correct angle value of the north
leg of the radian (it's off by 1-2&#176;); and<br />
<br />
c, why not also kidnap Darlene Ferrin?<br />
<br />
And my responses to these objections are:<br />
<br />
a, If one of the victims gets away during the kidnapping, the crime
resembles the Johns kidnapping except with a murder at the end (assuming
he kills the remaining victim), and then maybe he doesn't do the Johns
kidnapping.&nbsp; It's interesting that he does the Johns kidnapping after
all the public murder events, which to me suggests that nothing went
wrong earlier.<br />
<br />
b, Again, I don't think he ever felt he needed the radian to be EXACTLY
57.29&#176;.&nbsp; I think he assumed most (bright) people would get the point.&nbsp;
In any case, as I say elsewhere, someone jumping up and down and
screaming IT'S NOT A RADIAN! because it's off by a degree or two
completely misses the point, and I don't mean the point of the radian
mention.&nbsp; The reason I talk about the killer's INTENT in my intro
section is that his INTENT is really what matters, and that's true of
any attempted profiling of a conventional serial killer (though I'm no
longer sure there's any such thing).<br />
<br />
I'm not a huge fan of FBI profiling, but the insight that most serial
killers commit their first murder in their own neighborhoods, where they
feel more comfortable, should not be susceptible to some "skeptic"
pointing out that a particular first murder was across some invisible
boundary line on a map and thus, not in his neighborhood after all!&nbsp;
That's not argument; it's heckling, when the heckler has nothing
positive to contribute.<br />
<br />
c, My own take on Darlene Ferrin is that her movements were much more
predictable than most people's, that she had a small handful of places
where she liked to hang out (as David Fincher's movie makes clear), and
that, after initially following her around, the Zodiac conspirators came
to the conclusion that she was a very good bet to end up in that
clearing sometime on the night of July 4th (though they were almost
wrong about that).&nbsp; Thus, there was no need to further complicate
matters by kidnapping her.<br />
<br />
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">In any
case, another reason to abduct Kathleen Johns and then make sure she
gets away would be to show how easily a person&#8212;someone you chose
in advance--can be kidnapped.<br />

<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Note, finally, how the Zodiac killer words his threats to Kathleen.&nbsp; He
doesn&#8217;t say, &#8220;I&#8217;m going to kill you.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to die.&#8221;&nbsp; He says, &#8220;
YOU KNOW I&#8217;m going to kill you.&nbsp; YOU KNOW you&#8217;re going to die.&#8221;&nbsp; He is
deliberately setting up a demonstration of something that isn&#8217;t going to
happen, because she&#8217;s an inappropriate victim.&nbsp; So his wording reflects
that, even though it appears that he intends to do her harm, and even
though his words APPEAR to threaten her.<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><br />

<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Oh, I almost forgot!<br />
<br />
So why did the Zodiac drive her around for three hours, if he didn&#8217;t intend to kill her?<br />
<br />
Well, that&#8217;s the funny part!<br />
<br />
The Zodiac killer kept coming up to stop signs out on the rural roads
and slowing down and doing a Hollywood stop at each one, and kept
repeating over and over again, &#8220; You know I&#8217;m going to kill you.&nbsp; You
know you&#8217;re going to die . . .&#8221; <br />
<br />
It&#8217;s almost as if he were waiting for her to jump out!<br />
<br />
But she never did!<br />
<br />
So finally he drove the wrong way up a freeway exit and came to a stop
and left the car, at which point she grabbed her baby and ran off into
the weeds.<br />
<br />
My guess is Michael O&#8217;Hare heaved a big sigh of relief and said, &#8220; Finally!&#8221;<br />
<br />
In this particular episode, the Zodiac killer was stuck with an almost insoluble problem.<br />
<br />
He had to make it look like he really intended to kill her while somehow letting her get away.<br />
<br />
As I&#8217;ve pointed out, he generally struck very quickly, so the very fact
that he could drive Kathleen around for three hours tells you he never
intended for her to be a victim.<br />
<br />
Still, this is one of at least two instances during The Zodiac
Project&#8212;the other being the Channel 7 show, and the unfortunate phone
intrusion by the mental patient&#8212;where things don&#8217;t go according to the
Zodiac killer&#8217;s script.<br />
<br />
If you like your humor black, those moments are the comedy relief.<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><br />

</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
Any
murder investigator, especially one looking into a serial murder case
that&#8217;s decades old (and therefore, cold), MUST make assumptions.&nbsp; Unless
the murder scene gives up irrefutable forensic evidence that one can
immediately take into court, an investigator is forced to choose among
possible paths.&nbsp; These avenues open up like those before Armond
Pelissetti on the night of Paul Stine&#8217;s murder, when he started walking
down Cherry Street, wary of the darkness, and had to make a decision at
each intersection as to which way to go.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;ve always said that Robert Salem is a Zodiac victim.&nbsp; Other writers on
the case, including Robert Graysmith, have considered other victims who
MIGHT have been killed by the Zodiac, mainly because he&#8217;d hinted that
there WERE such &#8220;secret&#8221; victims that he didn&#8217;t boast about.&nbsp; When I
wrote the first edition of this book in 1990, Shelly Holmboe and Robert
Salem seemed the most likely &#8220;secret&#8221; victims, both in the details of
their deaths and in their places in the overall scheme, and nothing I&#8217;ve
learned in the last twenty years has changed that opinion.&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
I suspect that, though he was only the eighth individual victim
chronologically out of ten, Robert Salem was actually the last victim
chosen.&nbsp; In fact, I think it&#8217;s entirely possible that Salem would be
alive today if Michael Mageau hadn&#8217;t survived the attack at Blue Rock
Springs.<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">Robert Salem, 40, was a well-known lamp designer who lived and worked in
a residence/studio in the 700 block of Stevenson Street, an alley
behind The San Franciscan Hotel at 1231 Mission Street.&nbsp; On April 19,
1970, police responded to a complaint from people living in the rooms on
the back side of the hotel, of a horrible smell coming from the alley.&nbsp;
When they investigated, they found Salem&#8217;s nude body sprawled inside
his apartment in the midst of a bloody scene reminiscent of a
slaughterhouse.<br />
<br />
His killer or killers had turned the thermostat up to 90&#176;.<br />
<br />
Salem was stabbed multiple times and nearly decapitated.<br />
<br />
His left ear had been cut off.<br />
<br />
On the wall, printed in the victim&#8217;s blood, were the words<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>SATAN SAVES.</b><br />
<br />
An Egyptian ankh was drawn near the name<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>ZODIAC.</b><br />
<br />
The same symbol was drawn in blood on the victim&#8217;s stomach, though
Robert Graysmith calls it a &#8220;dripping red symbol of a crucified man&#8221;.<br />
<br />
The killer apparently used the shower after the murder.<br />
<br />
Police almost immediately decided the murder was not the work of the
real Zodiac killer, but a copycat effort.&nbsp; How they came to this
conclusion is anyone&#8217;s guess.<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Stanley Dean Baker</font></font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">No one has ever been convicted of the Robert Salem murder.<br />
<br />
A man named Stanley Dean Baker supposedly confessed to the murder to
California Highway Patrol detectives, adding that he carried away
Salem&#8217;s ear because he was a cannibal.<br />
<br />
Any number of suspects in other cases have been convicted on nothing
more substantial than their own confessions, but Baker was never even
charged in the Salem case.<br />
<br />
A reporter for USA Today wearily explained to me, some 20 years ago,
that police also had Baker&#8217;s fingerprints in blood at the scene.<br />
<br />
Frankly, I find this difficult to believe.&nbsp; Fingerprints in blood tend
to be very convincing to most juries, and there&#8217;s no statute of
limitations on murder.<br />
<br />
Baker was charged and convicted of the 1970 murder of James Schlosser,
and ultimately paroled in 1986 (no, I don&#8217;t understand why, either).&nbsp; He
was even allowed to take up a new identity (and, one hopes, a new diet)
in Wyoming.<br />
<br />
Why wouldn&#8217;t some ambitious young prosecutor go after Baker with the
signed confession and the bloody fingerprints?&nbsp; They could even have
done that while he was still in jail in Montana.&nbsp; It happens all the
time.&nbsp; The case would figure to be fairly straightforward . . . unless,
of course, police DON&#8217;T have any physical evidence against him.<br />
<br />
And perhaps don&#8217;t even have a confession.<br />
<br />
When James Schlosser&#8217;s body was found, it was missing its head, heart,
several fingers . . . and all four of his limbs had been hacked off.&nbsp;
The heart had supposedly been eaten raw and whole by Stanley Dean Baker.<br />
<br />
In contrast, there was no evidence of cannibalism at the Robert Salem
crime scene, except perhaps for the missing ear, which may or may not
have been eaten since there&#8217;s no sign of it.&nbsp; If he did kill Robert
Salem, Stanley Dean Baker apparently didn&#8217;t find his body very
appetizing.&nbsp; Why not?&nbsp; If he was such a compulsive cannibal, why wasn&#8217;t
he hungry that time?<br />
<br />
Another odd thing: James Schlosser was shot twice in the head before he
was cannibalized.&nbsp; The cutting up of his body was post-mortem.<br />
<br />
Robert Salem wasn&#8217;t shot, and his body wasn&#8217;t cut up.<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Gary Hinman Murder</font></font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
</font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">The Robert Salem murder bears a much more striking resemblance to murders committed by the Manson family in 1969.<br />
<br />
In fact, in many respects, it is identical to the murder of Gary Alan
Hinman, which was discovered on July 31, 1969, coincidentally the same
day the Zodiac mailed out The Cryptogram letters.&nbsp; Hinman&#8217;s face had
been deeply slashed on the left side, his left ear cut off, and he had
two stab wounds to the chest. <br />
<br />
Hinman's house had been ransacked and the words "Political Piggie" were
written on the wall in his blood, next to a panther paw, also in blood.&nbsp;
The panther paw was meant to leave the impresson that the Black
Panthers killed him.<br />
<br />
<b>In both murders, the victim&#8217;s left ear was cut off.<br />
<br />
In both murders, the killer or killers used the shower afterward.<br />
<br />
In both murders, words were written on the wall in blood.<br />
<br />
In both murders, a symbol was also drawn on the wall.</b><br />
<br />
It seems clear that the Salem murderer(s), at the very least, borrowed
ideas from the Hinman murderers.&nbsp; SFPD has called the Salem murder a
&#8220;copycat&#8221; crime, meaning the killer was trying to make the homicide look
like the work of the Zodiac killer.&nbsp; I think it is much more accurate
to say the killer was copying the Hinman murder, while affixing the
Zodiac&#8217;s name to it.<br />
<br />
So the question then becomes, was Stanley Dean Baker bright enough and
organized enough (for the FBI, this is always the key question when
dealing with serial killers) to have consciously copied the Hinman
murder?<br />
<br />
Maybe he was.&nbsp; I doubt it.<br />
<br />
Shortly after he killed James Schlosser, Stanley Dean Baker was
apprehended on suspicion of murder because he&#8217;d been driving Schlosser&#8217;s
car.<br />
<br />
He&#8217;d been driving Schlosser&#8217;s car on the wrong side of the road.<br />
<br />
While speeding.<br />
.<br />
Plus he was found to have a human index finger in his pocket.<br />
<br />
None of which sounds either bright or particularly organized.<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
<br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Bottomless Pit</font></font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">One additional idea linking the Zodiac and Manson murders must have been particularly striking to the Zodiac conspirators.<br />
<br />
Charles Manson intended his murders, he said, to trigger a race war
between blacks and whites, as supposedly suggested by the song &#8220;Helter
Skelter&#8221; from <b>The White Album</b> by The Beatles.&nbsp; Whites would
initially fight blacks, but since half the whites would oppose fighting
the blacks, the whites would end up annihilating each other and only the
blacks would be left.&nbsp; And then the Manson family would be left to rule
what was left of Mankind.<br />
<br />
How would the Manson family survive the race war?<br />
<br />
Manson speculated that they would ride out the storm in a hole in the
ground in Death Valley, in a place called The Bottomless Pit.&nbsp; In fact,
family members were looking for just such a place at the time of their
arrest.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m sure the reader would never believe that both mass murderer Charles
Manson and academic professional Michael O&#8217;Hare could ever BOTH be
quoted in newspapers as saying the same thing, right?<br />
<br />
But they were.<br />
<br />
When Michael O&#8217;Hare was asked to respond to Gareth Penn&#8217;s accusations by
The Boston Herald in 1987, he was quoted in the article as refusing to
do so because there would never be an end to it.<br />
<br />
Specifically, he said, &#8220;It&#8217;s a bottomless pit.&#8221;<br />
<br />
A &#8220;bottomless pit&#8221; is about as close to a description of Dante&#8217;s vision of Hell in <u>The Inferno</u> as you are likely to get.<br />
<br />
And no, I don&#8217;t think his wording was a coincidence.<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Set Piece?</font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">If you&#8217;re the Zodiac killer, operating in the years 1969-1970, is it
possible you&#8217;d find the notoriety of the Manson murders annoying?<br />
<br />
Particularly the Hinman murder?&nbsp; Particularly when discovery of the
Hinman murder on July 31, 1969--the same date you mail The
Cryptogram--and the subsequent coverage of the Manson murders steals
some of your thunder?<br />
<br />
Don&#8217;t get me wrong.<br />
<br />
I don&#8217;t think Michael, Gareth, Berta, and Hugh ever got emotional over how their masterpiece was being received publicly.<br />
<br />
But once the basic groundwork of The Zodiac Project had been established
in the summer and fall of 1969, they had the time and space to get
creative.<br />
<br />
The Zodiac killer had never been averse to responding to other events (<b>The Exorcist</b> movie, the Symbionese Liberation Army, a movie called <b>Badlands</b>
about serial killer Charles Starkweather) that might divert attention
from his own activities.&nbsp; The Zodiac Project was, among other things, a
PR machine.<br />
<br />
Is it possible the Zodiac killer would deliberately stage a murder to
resemble that of an infamous cult, just to make the point that it was
the Zodiac who was really deserving of all the attention?<br />
<br />
The Salem murder, in other words, would be a set piece.<br />
<br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 24px;"></font></font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Ankh</font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">So let&#8217;s return to our original assumption:<br />
<br />
Robert Salem wasn&#8217;t killed by Stanley Dean Baker.<br />
<br />
And no one else has been charged with his murder.<br />
<br />
So . . . could he be a Zodiac victim?<br />
<br />
Let&#8217;s look at the symbol he draws on the wall and on Salem&#8217;s stomach.<br />
<br />
An Egyptian ankh.&nbsp; Which is a symbol of life.&nbsp; It was commonly found on tombs in ancient Egypt.&nbsp; It stood for eternal life.<br />
<br />
For the afterlife.<br />
<br />
And we know that the Zodiac killer is preoccupied with symbols such as
the Egyptian phoenix.&nbsp; Again, the idea is that when he dies, he will
live forever.&nbsp; So leaving the ankhs is consistent with what the Zodiac
killer is doing.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Last Day</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">We&#8217;ve looked at two concepts from the ancient Egyptian religion, the phoenix and the ankh.<br />
<br />
I want now to look at a ceremony from the Roman pagan religion.<br />
<br />
Remember what I&#8217;ve been saying about the Zodiac killer:&nbsp; He sacrifices
victims to place them at specific points on the landscape, to mark off
his designs.<br />
<br />
The Roman religion does the same thing, except it uses the sacrifice
ceremony to mark off property.&nbsp; The ancient Romans were practical about
everything, including their religious beliefs.&nbsp; If they&#8217;d had cars,
they&#8217;d have had a god of parking meters.&nbsp; The god of border stones,
marking off property, was called Terminus.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll quote from Wikipedia:<br />
<br />
<b>In Roman religion, Terminus was the god who protected boundary
markers; his name was the Latin word for such a marker. Sacrifices were
performed to sanctify each boundary stone, and landowners celebrated a
festival called the Terminalia in Terminus' honor each year on February
23.</b><br />
<br />
February 23rd was the last day of the Roman calendar.<br />
To write it with numbers, we use 2-23.<br />
<br />
The last day.<br />
<br />
On the last day, the marker stones laid will be consecrated by a victim's blood.<br />
<br />
The last day of our own calendar is December 31st.&nbsp; We write it 12-31.<br />
<br />
The Napa Car Wash, from which the Zodiac called the police in Napa, was at 1231 Main Street.<br />
<br />
The San Franciscan Hotel, which Salem&#8217;s studio was behind, was at 1231 Mission Street.<br />
<br />
<br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Death Date</font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">When did Robert Salem die?<br />
<br />
His body was found, because it was decomposing and people in the back
rooms of the hotel were complaining about the smell, on Sunday, April
19, 1970.<br />
<br />
So we can be sure he was killed quite some time before that.<br />
But when, exactly?<br />
<br />
The medical examiner&#8217;s guess was April 12th, but the intense heat inside the apartment would have blurred any estimate.<br />
<br />
Here&#8217;s the interesting thing:<br />
<br />
Three of the Zodiac victims have the word EASTER in their names.<br />
<br />
Remember, I said Easter is the finished product of Dante&#8217;s Inferno.<br />
<br />
Easter Sunday in 1970 was March 29.<br />
<br />
Obviously, that date would be a plausible day for Salem to have died.&nbsp;
It is also the exact midpoint between the deaths of Shelly Holmboe and
Donna Lass.<br />
<br />
<b>Shelly Holmboe&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</b></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><b><font style="font-size: 16px;"> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font style="font-size: 16px;">Robert Salem&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font><font style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </font><font style="font-size: 16px;">Donna Lass</font><br />

<br />
Remember, I don&#8217;t need the Robert Salem murder to make my case.&nbsp; Because
the distance between the Holmboe murder and the Donna Lass murder is
still exactly 46 weeks, which is 2 x 23.&nbsp; But if Salem is murdered on
Easter Sunday, now you&#8217;ve got three &#8220;secret&#8221; Zodiac victims whose murder
dates are connected by two 23-week intervals which flank Easter Sunday.<br />
<br />
In other words, symmetry.<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">An article on Robert Salem (&#8220;The Lamplighter of Stevenson Street&#8221;),
written while he was still alive, was published on March 30, 1969 in The
San Francisco Examiner&#8217;s Sunday edition.<br />
<br />
<img alt="" width="689" height="500" src="images/02a90d48a63447ec27b8079cd8eaea76.jpg" /><br />
<br />
</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">
Again, if Salem was murdered on March 29th, that would be the 365th day
since the Salem article.&nbsp; It was, in effect, the last day of a year
beginning with that article.&nbsp; So the murder of Robert Salem on that date
would be another way of invoking the Terminus and 2-23.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s interesting that the Salem murder would thus turn the normal Zodiac
killer sequence on its head: instead of him killing a victim and then
writing to the newspapers about it, in this case the murder would FOLLOW
an article about the victim in the newspaper.<br />

Very often during The Zodiac Project there are little hints and clues
such as The Examiner article which, in effect, say, &#8220;If you just look at
the information that&#8217;s available on this person, you may be able to
figure all this out.&#8221;&nbsp; That never happened because everyone assumed he
was killing people randomly, which in at least a couple of cases (Cheri
Bates and Darlene Ferrin, because conventional evidence shows he was
stalking them personally) we know wasn&#8217;t true.</font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">The SF Examiner article on Robert Salem that was published on March 30,
1969 in the Sunday edition was entitled, &#8220;The Lamplighter Of Stevenson
Street.&#8221;<br />
<br />
The Zodiac killer twice used a song from Gilbert and Sullivan&#8217;s &#8220;The
Mikado&#8221; (in the July 25th, 1970 Mikado Letter, and in the January 29th,
1974 Exorcist Letter).<br />
<br />
The Examiner calls Salem &#8220;The Lamplighter of Stevenson Street&#8221;. &nbsp;<br />
<br />
The name of the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan troupe in San Francisco?<br />
<br />
The Lamp Lighters.<br />
<br />

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">What about the message on the wall?<br />
I mean, besides the name ZODIAC?&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>SATAN<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
SAVES</b><br />
<br />
Those two words are alliterative, just like the words on the wall at the Hinman murder.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>POLITICAL<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;PIGGIE</b><br />
<br />
What&#8217;s even more interesting is that you have three words connected to
this particular murder that consist of five letters (remembering that
pentagrams are associated with Satan), and all three words start with
&#8216;S-A&#8217;.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>SATAN<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SAVES<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;SALEM</b><br />
<br />
If we put those first two letters in columns like an acrostic and add up their alphabet numbers, we get an interesting result.<br />
<br />
<b>S&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;19&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;A &nbsp;&nbsp; 1&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; TAN<br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>57.3</b><br />
<br />
57.3 is about as close an approximation as you can get to the radian angle value, 57.29&#176;.</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">If this seems a stretch (and I&#8217;m sure it does), note also that the Salem
murder is a sub-radian off the south leg of the Mt. Diablo radian.<br />
<br />
Here is an illustration page from my book (Illustration #60, obviously),
which features the south leg of The Mt. Diablo Radian superimposed over
a USGS quadrangle map page which includes Presidio Heights and
Chinatown, "San Francisco North".&nbsp; The south leg comes in from the right
(east), and ends at the intersection of Washington &amp; Cherry
Streets:</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

is the same map page, now showing two additional points, 739 Clay
Street, the site of BM 54, the only USGS benchmark on the south leg of
The Mt. Diablo Radian, and the Robert Salem murder site (his
apartment/studio on Stevenson Street). <br />
<br />
If one draws a line from BM 54 in Dragon Plaza to the Salem murder scene
on Stevenson Street, that line creates another radian, a sub-radian:<br />

</font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">It also makes the Mt. Diablo Radian symmetrical, in terms of the number of murders on each:<br />
<br />
North Leg: David Faraday + Betty Lou Jensen + Darlene Ferrin = 3<br />
<br />
South Leg: Paul Stine + Donna Lass + Robert Salem = 3<br />

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;">I will cite more reasons to believe the Salem murder was authored by the
Zodiac killer later in the book.&nbsp; In the meantime, let&#8217;s review:<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; <b>1. Stanley Dean Baker was convicted of the James Schlosser murder.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 2. Baker was never even charged in the Salem murder.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 3. The Salem and Schlosser murders don&#8217;t resemble each other.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 4. The Salem murder is a copy of the Gary Hinman (Manson) murder.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 5. The Salem murder is a set piece, signed by the ZODIAC.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 6. The ankh drawn in blood is a symbol of death-and-rebirth.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 7. The Zodiac killer victim-placement resembles the Roman Terminus ceremony.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 8. The Terminus ceremony sacrificed animals to set border stones.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 9. The Terminus ceremony took place on the last day of the calendar year.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;10. The last day of the Roman year was February 23rd, 2-23.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;11. The last day of our modern year is December 31st, 12-31.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;12. The San Franciscan Hotel is at 1231 Mission Street.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;13. The phone call to the police in Napa was from 1231 Main Street.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;14. Robert Salem may have been murdered on Easter Sunday, March 29, 1970.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;15. Easter 1970 is the midpoint between the Holmboe and Lass murders.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;16. Easter 1970 bissects the 46 weeks between Holmboe and Lass&#8212;2 x 23.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;17. March 29, 1970 was the last day of a year after the Examiner article.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;18. The article&#8217;s keyword&#8212;LampLighter&#8212;references Gilbert and Sullivan.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;19. SATAN, SAVES, and SALEM add up acrostically to 57.3, a radian.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;20. The murder site is a radian off the south leg of the Mt. Diablo radian.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;21. The Salem murder makes the Mt. Diablo Radian symmetrical.</b><br />
