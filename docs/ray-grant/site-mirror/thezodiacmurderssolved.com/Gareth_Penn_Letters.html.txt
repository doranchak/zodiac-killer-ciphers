I just bought a new Fujitsu scanner that allows for high-quality scanning of
documents many pages long. Prior to this I haven't done much scanning because I
had an HP flatbed scanner which you have to load a page at a time, and the
pages are hard to read once you've posted them onto a website. I'm hoping I can
now scan all the editions of my book right onto the website, plus lots of other
case documents I've accumulated over the past 27 years.

Speaking of things that began 27 years ago, I will be presenting numerous
Gareth Penn mailings from the 1980s. I will start with the letters Gareth
addressed to me personally. Back in the 1980s, if you had an article you wanted
your fans to read, you didn't have the recourse of posting it on a website,
since there were no websites. Instead, you typed it up, had it photocopied, and
then mailed it off in manila envelopes to everyone on your mailing list.

For every letter Gareth addressed to me personally, there's at least one typed
presentation of some point (usually cryptographic) he needed to make. Also keep
in mind that Gareth and I were talking on the phone as often as we were sending
letters back and forth; I don't have transcripts of those calls, but a few of
them bear scrutiny in the light of later events.

I will present the letters addressed to me first, and then do the handouts.
Since this is new technology to me, I will probably be tweaking the
presentation as I learn more about how to make it look better on the website.
Also, let me stress that, because I've tried to make the site simpler for me to
add things, I will probably be editing this chapter and adding things to it as
I go, so don't assume you've seen everything if you've only clicked on it once.

As I type these words, it is August 11, 2012, exactly 23 years after the date
of the intended denouement of The Zodiac Project, The Terminus Event of August
11, 1989.

Ironically, exactly TWO years ago, a poster on ZKF who calls himself ZSEARCHER,
but whose real name is Tom DiMarco, came up with this comment on his own
"Where's The Evidence" thread over there:

I do not deny knowing Ray Grant. I was asked, &#8220;Why didn&#8217;t you ever
sue your friend Ray?&#8221;, and I responded, &#8220;I don&#8217;t have a
friend named Ray, nor do I know anyone, even casually, with that name. The last
Ray I can remember having known&#8230;&#8221; (see above). You will note that I
was not asked if I knew Ray Grant; I was asked why I wasn&#8217;t suing my
&#8220;friend Ray [no surname]&#8221; It&#8217;s important, when you hold
someone responsible for something he has said, that you quote what he actually
said and not something that you have fabricated. I do not, in fact, have a
friend named Ray, I do not currently know anyone with that name, and until you
jogged my memory, I did not recall Ray Grant (you will note that I did not
categorically deny ever having known anyone named &#8220;Ray&#8221; other than
the ones I cited; I wrote &#8220;The last Ray I can remember&#8221;). Ray Grant
is just one of hundreds of people with whom I corresponded a quarter century
ago, most of whose names I have not retained. I would not characterize him as a
&#8220;friend.&#8221; He presented to me a convoluted theory about the
Zodiac&#8217;s use of firearms, apparently seeking my endorsement. I
didn&#8217;t agree with him and told him so. He seemed to feel that he was
entitled to my endorsement and became very bitter and accusatory. I
haven&#8217;t read anything he has had to say since then and so have no idea
what his current theories are. I gather from what you say that he has spent the
last quarter century pouting. Now that he knows that I haven&#8217;t been
paying attention to his slandering of me, he will probably pout even more. I
regret that you feel that I am high-handed and supercilious, but I got the
feeling that he felt the same way about me simply because I didn&#8217;t buy
his theory. I don&#8217;t remember specifically, but I may have sent him those
photos back in the days before I turned him into an implacable foe by having
the temerity to disagree with him. Apparently, some people believe that because
all men are created equal, the same is true of all theories, and I suspect that
by not applying the principles of Jeffersonian democracy to other
people&#8217;s ideas, you run the risk of being called &#8220;high-
handed&#8221; and &#8220;supercilious.&#8221;

Going by that logic, 25 years ago Tom DiMarco must have walked up to the actor
Peter O'Toole and asked for an autograph . . . and got snubbed. Now I know why
DiMarco thinks Lawrence of Arabia is the Zodiac killer.

As far as my being snubbed by Penn . . . didn't happen. And here are the
letters to prove it.

Let's look at a critical passage from Gareth's post above:

HHee pprreesseenntteedd ttoo mmee aa ccoonnvvoolluutteedd tthheeoorryy aabboouutt tthhee ZZooddiiaacc&&##88221177;;ss uussee ooff

Gareth is talking here about page 5 from the December 14, 1986 letter below.
The theory he is disagreeing with can be found elsewhere right on this website:

_s_e_e_:_ _G_u_n_ _N_u_m_b_e_r_s_ _1_-_3

I mentioned my theory to Gareth, he clearly disagreed with it in the letter, I
wrote back answering his own points . . . and then we both dropped the subject.
If I became very bitter and accusatory, you sure couldn't tell it from his own
letters to me. And Gareth went on writing to me, quite cordially, until his
last letter in May 1990. Gareth sent the last three letters of the
correspondence and even sent me pictures of himself and his then-spouse, Diane
Merrill, including their wedding photo at a Mensa event.



What I said to Tom DiMarco back then, I will say yet again:

IIff yyoouu kknneeww mmoorree aabboouutt tthhee ccaassee,, yyoouu''dd hhaavvee aa ddiiffffeerreenntt ooppiinniioonn.. TTrruusstt mmee..

Where was I? Oh, yes. Here are the letters Gareth sent to me, not including the
hand-outs. I may post those as well in the near future. I'm including what
looks like a hand-out that Gareth sent on May 22, 1990, because I may be the
only one who received it.

I posted these pages in the wee hours of Saturday morning. I was looking at the
website late this evening (still Saturday) and noticed that most of the pages
scan with a yellowish tint, presumably from the age of the paper, but some
others scan as white. I'm not sure if this is because of some glitch in the
scanner software or if those particular pages were copies of the originals. If
the reader will go to my video from last October, Zodiac Killer Solved 13 . . .


_Z_o_d_i_a_c_ _K_i_l_l_e_r_ _S_o_l_v_e_d_ _1_3

. . . I hold up the box I've kept the letters in for the past quarter-century
or so. I did notice, as I was going through the various papers in the box, that
some I'd copied for one reason or another (mostly the handouts, but also some
letters). When I did the scanning, I thought I'd used the originals when there
was more than one copy, but I suppose it's possible some copies got mixed in
with the originals. The reader will notice that most of the first pages of the
letters feature the outline of a rusty paper clip that's been removed before
scanning. In any case, these pages are what Gareth mailed to me for the most
part, with a possibly copied page mixed in here and there. It occurs to me now
that I may have copied some original pages to make them more readable when I
was scanning them onto ZKS a couple years ago; the white pages look easier to
read than the yellow ones.

If the reader has any trouble reading what's scanned here, he can probably fix
the problem by using the ZOOM function on his web browser to blow the page up a
bit.
















































































I just found page 4 of this letter; I'm sure I still have the third page
somewhere but haven't found it yet. In any case, page 4 is quite interesting
since it includes information about Hugh Penn.















































As I said, I will be adding to this article in the very near future as I sift
through other stuff Gareth sent me. In the meantime, I want the reader to
notice something EXTREMELY ODD about that last page I scanned, just above.

I cited three instances in the article 11998800//11998811 of Gareth citing facts that
were blatantly untrue.


1. Gareth cites a 2nd page of text in The Mt. Diablo Letter, when there IS no
2nd page of text.

2. Gareth cites a book at The Napa City & County Library, when there IS no such
book.

3. Gareth cites bombs w/timers igniting The Atlas Peak Fire, when no such
devices were found.


Now we have yet a 4th example of the well-educated, meticulous Gareth Penn with
his degree in library science from Cal-Berkeley, citing a raw fact that is
simply not true:

"" .. .. .. BBeenncchhmmaarrkk 99,, aatt TThhee GGrreeyyhhoouunndd bbuuss tteerrmmiinnaall iinn ddoowwnnttoowwnn BBoossttoonn,, wwhheerree
JJooaann WWeebbsstteerr''ss mmuurrddeerreerr lleefftt hheerr ssuuiittccaassee .. .. ..""

It's true that Joan Webster's murderer left her suitcase in a storage locker at
the bus terminal.

But The Greyhound Bus Terminal doesn't contain USGS Benchmark 9. In fact, that
building doesn't contain a USGS benchmark of any designation. The benchmark
found at that location on that USGS quadrangle is, in fact, located at 175
Berkeley Street, the address of The Liberty Mutual Building. And the benchmark
in that building was releveled in 1966, and is, in fact, Benchmark 3, NOT
Benchmark 9 (though granted, the maps still say "BM9"). Here is a copy of the
USGS quadrangle "Boston South" with Gareth's annotations in red; BM9 is in the
center:



Now the reader is probably chuckling to himself about how the great Gareth Penn
could make such an honest mistake. Except it's not an honest mistake. The only
way you can locate a USGS Benchmark is to find a particular BM designation on a
USGS map and then contact the USGS, at which point they will locate the data
for that benchmark and read it to you over the phone and/or send it to you in
the mail.



Another way of saying this is, You just CAN'T misidentify a USGS benchmark,
because the only way you can get information about one is to contact the USGS.

And you certainly can't mistake it for a location that DOESN'T contain a
benchmark.

In other words, Gareth didn't misidentify that benchmark by mistake.

He did it on purpose.

So let me ask my pet question again:

At what point does Gareth Penn's behavior (and Michael O'Hare's behavior, for
that matter) become so BIZARRE that a Zodiac hobbyist will actually begin to
question it?

Oh, wait. I was sifting through the box of letters from my Secret Penn Pal,
this time looking for his article/handouts, and I found another entire letter
from December 23, 1986. What's particularly interesting about this letter is
that it comes just 9 days after the alleged argument between Gareth and myself
(December 14, 1986--see letter above) that supposedly resulted in my becoming
Gareth's "implacable foe".

I want Tom DiMarco to pay special attention to this missive/missile, since it
pretty well nukes his theory that Gareth "snubbed" me, which then resulted in
my accusation that Gareth is the Zodiac. Gareth IS the Zodiac, mind you, or one
of the four, but I didn't come to that conclusion because I was bitter about
his treatment of me. Note that Gareth is soliciting a special favor from me in
the letter; that strikes me as being the opposite of a "snub". Also note that
Gareth acknowledges the counter-arguments in my own letter and then immediately
asks for my help, demonstrating that there was nothing particularly heated
about our disagreement.

As I said, If you knew more about the case, you'd have a different opinion.

Trust me.





Again, I will be adding more material here in the very near future.
