I divide all cryptography into three categories:

a. SSeerriioouuss CCrryyppttooggrraapphhyy, which is the kind used by intelligence bureaus of
governments and by security departments of big companies. The Purple Code and
The Japanese Naval Code are examples of Serious Cryptography, which The Zodiac
Project isn't . . . as far as I can tell.

b. BBaabbyy BBlloocckk CCrryyppttooggrraapphhyy, which is the kind found on the puzzle page of most
newspapers. Most of the cryptographic insights made in this book are examples
of Baby Block (for example, the most basic kind of letter-to-number code is
A=1, B=2, C=3, and this very simple conversion is what's used for most of the
Zodiac killer's major points).

and c. DDeeccooddeerr RRiinngg CCrryyppttooggrraapphhyy, which is Baby Block taken a step or two
further, of which The Cryptogram is an example.

Earlier versions of this book contained Decoder Ring Analysis of all the Zodiac
documents. I literally digitized every single Zodiac letter and message,
scanned them using the SEARCH function of my word processor, and highlighted
the most interesting results in a grid on the page. If I end up doing anything
like that in this edition, it will be in the form of an image scan of the
earlier material. In any case, I've come to the conclusion, after twenty years
and several editions of this book, that my time is better served trying to
explain:

a, WHAT the Zodiac killer was doing;

b, WHY he was doing it; and

c, in some cases, HOW he was doing it.

But I do have to take out my Decoder Ring to deal with The Cryptogram, so I'll
try to make this chapter as painless as possible (it may still hurt, though).



Cryptogram Facts

1. On August 1, 1969, The Vallejo Times-Herald, The San Francisco Examiner, and
The San Francisco Chronicle each received one-third of a cryptogram, postmarked
the day before. The cover letter for each was essentially the same message with
minor variations.

2. Each third was 8 lines by 17 columns, the total cipher consisting of 24
lines of 17 characters.

3. The language of the cover letters lacked verbal sophistication, yet the
cipher itself was clever enough to frustrate the CIA, FBI, NSA, and other
experts.

4. The Salinas couple who did come up with the solution--Donald Harden and his
wife Bettye--commented on how cleverly The Cryptogram was constructed, in such
a way as to discourage easy deciphering. A local expert on codes agreed that
the Zodiac killer obviously &#8220;knew his business&#8221; when it came to
constructing ciphers.

5. Nonetheless, the solution disappointed both the Hardens and police. The
plaintext message was nothing more than a theme-and-variations on his motives
for murder (I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE BECAUSE IT IS SO MUCH FUN . . . ),

6. The Zodiac killer had apparently been bluffing about the cipher containing
his name, unless the gibberish at the end (EBEORIETEMETHHPITI) was an anagram
for his signature.


Cryptogram Non-Facts

Four aspects of The Cryptogram were misunderstood at the time of its
publication:

Cryptogram Non-Solution

If The Cryptogram contained clues to its solution, it also featured many hints
about the kind of person(s) who composed it. For example, The Cryptogram was a
multiple-substitution cipher with seven different symbols representing the most
common letter, &#8216;E&#8217;.

The &#8220;solved&#8221; message, on the other hand, was childlike in its
simplicity.

II LLIIKKEE KKIILLLLIINNGG PPEEOOPPLLEE BBEECCAAUUSSEE IITT IISS SSOO MMUUCCHH FFUUNN .. .. ..

Shouldn&#8217;t someone have come out and said, &#8220;It can&#8217;t be that
simple?&#8221; No one goes to that much trouble to convey such an idiotic
message!

When NASA sent Voyager out beyond the solar system, the accompanying disc
didn&#8217;t consist entirely of a sound recording of &#8220;When You Wish Upon
A Star.&#8221;

Maybe it should have? Voyager might land on a planet like ours, be confiscated
by the local police, and they may not &#8220;get&#8221; the BINARY message that
was on the real disc!


Whose Puzzle?

I can&#8217;t present the Harden solution to The Cryptogram . . . because
it&#8217;s wrong.

It&#8217;s not that the Hardens themselves did anything wrong, they were just
working on something that WASN&#8217;T the Zodiac&#8217;s Cryptogram. Here is
what I believe the Zodiac killer actually sent, as copied from Gareth Penn's
TTiimmeess 1177:



Apparently, between the time The Cryptogram was received (Friday, August 1,
1969) and when the entire thing was published (Sunday, August 3, 1969), police
changed at least 19 symbols of the original grid:



Whoever did it did a good job--the rank and file of the cipher grid was
maintained, and more than half the changes involved simply filling in empty
square symbols. My guess is, the substitution was done by a police sketch
artist. Police do things like this so that if the real Zodiac comes forward and
says, &#8220;Hey that&#8217;s not what I sent you,&#8221; they&#8217;ve got
him!

I know this because Gareth Penn used a slightly different set of symbols from
the ones shown in Graysmith&#8217;s ZZooddiiaacc, presumably because his father was
in law enforcement and had access to the originals (though I don&#8217;t recall
Gareth ever actually explaining this):



 I&#8217;m doing the method of change here off the top of my head, so I
don&#8217;t swear by the accuracy of each individual change. Remember,
Gareth&#8217;s symbols were the originals; Graysmith&#8217;s were post-change.

Two quick quibbles:

1, Gareth Penn has backward-F in Line 6, Columns 2 and 7 of The SFC; Graysmith
has backward-E. As you can see, I circled the second instance in my earlier
editions (scanned above). I'm inclined to think Gareth simply mistyped, since
otherwise one would have to substitute DOLLEDTING for COLLECTING. Further
analysis is called for here, but I don't have time to do it right now, and I
doubt that the difference would be worth my delaying the rest of the book for
(but I've been wrong before).

2, Michael Rodelli has made the interesting suggestion that police may have
solved The Cryptogram on Friday or Saturday and THEN changed the symbol grid
for the Sunday paper to trick the killer into coming forward with his own
(corrected) solution. Mike bases this insight on the fact that at least one of
the changes (WILE to WILL) corrects a misspelling in the cipher text. If he's
right, it makes the script of David Fincher's movie, which makes fun of the
cipher being solved in the breakfast nook of the Hardens, look foolish.

In any case, without going into cryptographic detail, it&#8217;s clear that
Gareth&#8217;s version of The Cryptogram is more internally consistent, so
that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going with:

I realize some readers are going to drily remark, after a quick comparison,
that the difference between versions wasn&#8217;t worth commenting on. And for
the purposes of this book, they&#8217;re right. The differences are subtle
enough that I won&#8217;t end up discussing them here. But since we&#8217;re
dealing with what cryptographers call a &#8220;two-step cipher&#8221;, where
the apparent solution is just the middle step in the process, even a small
change could affect the final reading. And since I&#8217;m going to use the
correct solution, I thought I&#8217;d explain why.


Cipher Identity

Sometimes the Zodiac killer sent the most important clue to one of his
mysteries in the next mailing or shortly thereafter. For instance, he sent The
Mt. Diablo Code in his letter of June 26, 1970, and then mentioned radians in
the postscript of a letter the following month (July 25, 1970). In the very
next letter after The Cryptogram (August 7, 1969), he called himself &#8216;the
Zodiac&#8217; for the first time:

TThhiiss iiss tthhee ZZooddiiaacc ssppeeaakkiinngg..

One would assume he reserved this nominal coming-out party for some significant
information. True to form, he gave it to us parenthetically:

BByy tthhee wwaayy,, aarree tthhee ppoolliiccee
hhaavveeiinngg aa ggoooodd ttiimmee wwiitthh tthhee

tthheeyy wwiillll hhaavvee mmee..

In the four decades since this letter was sent, people have assumed that the
Zodiac killer was merely amusing himself. After all, the last full sentence of
The Cryptogram solution says, like a surprise punchline, that he will NOT give
his name.

II WWIILLEE NNOOTT GGIIVVEE YYOOUU MMYY NNAAMMEE BBEECCAAUUSSEE YYOOUU WWIILLLL TTRRYY TTOO SSLLOOII DDOOWWNN OORR SSTTOOPP MMYY

But he never said The Cryptogram contained his NAME. He said

IInn tthhiiss cciipphheerr iiss mmyy iiddeennttiittyy..

Your identity can consist of any number of things besides your name.
The Zodiac killer isn&#8217;t telling us his name. He&#8217;s telling us who he
is.

aarree tthhee ppoolliiccee
hhaavveeiinngg aa ggoooodd ttiimmee wwiitthh tthhee
ccooddee??

Note that he uses the word &#8216;code&#8217;. The Cryptogram isn&#8217;t a
code; it&#8217;s an independently encrypted document--a &#8216;cipher&#8217;. A
code is a general system of encryption. So he&#8217;s not really talking about
The Cryptogram itself. He&#8217;s saying, "Have you figured out my language
yet?" Figure out his language, and you&#8217;ll figure out who he is.


Two-Step Ciphers

So The Cryptogram was just a big joke, right? A big build-up to an idiotic
payoff?

Not exactly. Remember, both the Hardens and the professional codebreakers who
studied The Cryptogram found it to be cryptographically sophisticated. So . . .
does it make sense that someone smart enough to construct a multiple
substitution cipher--one using seven different symbols for the letter E in a
meticulously repeating sequence--would then make use of that complex mechanism
to gush ungrammatically about the joys of multiple murder?

No. But he might do that if The Cryptogram were really a two-step cipher.

A two-step cipher has three layers. On top is the cipher text, also called the
cover text. Even when you decipher it correctly, the solution is disappointing,
because it&#8217;s only the first stage of a two-step process. You either get
what looks like gibberish (EBEORIETEMETHHPITI), or you get an innocuous message
(I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE . . . ). You only get the real solution when you go that
second step.

So . . . why don&#8217;t we try out this revolutionary idea? Let&#8217;s use
some of our decoding methods on The Cryptogram&#8217;s &#8220;solution&#8221;,
and see if we get a different message entirely!


LIKE

II LLIIKKEE KKIILLLLIINNGG PPEEOOPPLLEE

Oddly enough, I don&#8217;t think this is true. In the one non-shooting murder
for which we have a witness, Lake Berryessa, the Zodiac killer seems almost to
be forcing himself to go through with it. Bryan Hartnell describes a Zodiac who
says little, acts mechanically, and breathes hard throughout his stabbing
attack. Hardly the impression a cackling, orgiastic killer would make!

Nevertheless, something about those first two words is familiar!

II LLIIKKEE

II LL II KK EE
99 1122 ++ 99 ++ 1111 ++ 55 == 3377

II LLIIKKEE
99 ++ 3377 == 4466

The first thing we notice is that I LIKE adds up to 46 in alphabet numbers. So
he&#8217;s starting off the document with a form of 2 x 23. That in itself
would seem to indicate we&#8217;re on the right track! But let&#8217;s look
again. Remember what we said about the scorecard number at the bottom of the
Zodiac killer&#8217;s Exorcist Letter?

MMee -- 3377

The Zodiac killer usually uses one of two numbers, 6 or 9, to equate himself to
something. The number 6 is Morse/binary ME; the number 9 is the 9th letter,
&#8216;I&#8217;.

II LLIIKKEE
99 3377

Again, he&#8217;s making the same statement he made to equate himself to pi:

II ((aamm)) 3377..

I. e., &#8220; I am pi,&#8221; or 3 followed by 7 decimal digits which spells
ZODIAC. I will come back to this in a moment.


KILLING PEOPLE

Let&#8217;s look at the next two words, using the same approach:

KKIILLLLIINNGG PPEEOOPPLLEE

KK II LL LL II NN GG
1111 ++ 99 ++ 1122 ++ 1122 ++ 99 ++ 1144 ++ 77 == 7744

PP EE OO PP LL EE
1166 ++ 55 ++ 1155 ++ 1166 ++ 1122 ++ 55 == 6699

KKIILLLLIINNGG PPEEOOPPLLEE just happens to add up to 7744--6699. Or, to add a dash of emphasis,
77--44--6699.

77--44--6699 would indicate JJuullyy 44tthh,, 11996699.

Remember, I said the Darlene Ferrin murder actually took place a few minutes
after midnight on July 5th, 1969, but the Zodiac killer kept insisting in his
letters that it happened on July 4th? Now you know why the Zodiac killer wanted
the Ferrin murder to happen on July 4th, 1969.

So that, on that day, he would be KILLING PEOPLE!


Mistakes

Gareth Penn once said that the Zodiac killer intended to kill Darlene Ferrin on
July 4, 1969, but wasn&#8217;t quite able to manage it. I now suspect the
Zodiac intentionally waited until after midnight to shoot the couple in the
Blue Rock Springs parking lot. If you watch David Fincher&#8217;s movie ZZooddiiaacc_,
you will see the Zodiac killer pull into the parking lot behind them, then
drive off, then come back and start shooting. Partly this is because there has
to be some voluntary aspect to what the victims do, in keeping with the pagan
sacrifice rituals, a subject which I will cover in a later section. I. e., he
has to give them a chance to drive away.

Since the victims don&#8217;t know he&#8217;s about to start shooting them,
he&#8217;s not giving them much of a chance, but there has to be at least the
appearance of compliance on their part (in keeping with their being voluntary
passengers).

The same is true of other victims. Cheri Bates appears to have walked off with
her killer. Her killer even says, in The Confession Letter, &#8220;SHE WENT
VERY WILLINGLY.&#8221; David Faraday and Betty Lou Jensen apparently chose to
park in that spot along Lake Herman Road. Paul Stine let the Zodiac killer into
his car and then went where the Zodiac killer told him to go. Again, these
victims were unaware of what was in store for them, so their actions
weren&#8217;t really voluntary, but they SEEMED to cooperate in their fate.

But the more immediate reason to wait until after midnight to begin shooting is
that it allows him to call attention to his mistake. Thus, neither of the
&#8220;dates&#8221; given in The Cryptogram cover letters, or in the follow-up
&#8220;This is the Zodiac speaking" Letter of August 4, 1969, is accurate.

CChhrriissttmmaassss 44tthh JJuullyy

Those are both wrong. The &#8220;Christmas&#8221; murders actually took place
on December 20, 1968.
And the July 4th murder took place in the early minutes of July 5, 1969.

The Zodiac killer used apparent mistakes to call attention to some aspect of
his scheme.
I will point out other such &#8220;mistakes&#8221; as we stumble over them.


Three Parts

Just in case you were wondering, he divides The Cryptogram into 3 parts because
the Devil in DDaannttee&&##88221177;;ss IInnffeerrnnoo has three heads. Metaphorically, it&#8217;s
just that simple.

But another, more practical reason to do it is that newspapers are in
competition with one another. When The Vallejo Times-Herald, The San Francisco
Examiner, and The San Francisco Chronicle all receive a third of a
killer&#8217;s cryptogram, one of the three papers is bound to publish it. And
once that happens, the other two will follow suit.

The Zodiac killer could not take the chance with this, his most important piece
of information, that the publication might come down to editorial whim. So he
divides The Cryptogram into three pieces and sends it off to the three major
newspapers in the San Francisco Bay Area. David Fincher&#8217;s movie has
several scenes devoted to the editorial decision, on the part of The San
Francisco Chronicle, to publish the letter.


390 18

I mentioned that the Zodiac killer never said The Cryptogram contained his
name, i. e., it doesn&#8217;t contain 'Michael O&#8217;Hare'. However, he did
say The Cryptogram contained his identity.

&&##88222200;;II ((aamm)) ppii..&&##88222211;;

Again, he is pi because the binary/Morse form of pi spells out

MM..EERRAAHHOO.

So there must be a reference to pi in The Cryptogram. And there is. I already
mentioned that the first two words of the solution,

II LLIIKKEE,

--actually means

&&##88222200;;II ((aamm)) ppii..&&##88222211;;

But the FORM of The Cryptogram says the same thing. It consists of 390
characters of a statement (I LIKE KILLING PEOPLE . . .), followed by 18
characters of apparent gibberish (EBEORIETEMETHHPITI). The closest one can come
to the relationship between 3 and .1415926 in 408 characters is to divide them
390/18.

33 //&&nnbbsspp;; ..11441155992266 == 2211..11887755 .. .. ..

389 /&nbsp; 19 = 20.4737

339900 //&&nnbbsspp;; 1188 == 2211..66666666

391 /&nbsp; 17 = 23


The form of The Cryptogram is itself a representation of pi.

Ready for something a bit more challenging?

It&#8217;s time we tackled one of the great unsolved mysteries of the Zodiac
case&#8212;those final 18 letters of The Cryptogram, EBEORIETEMETHHPITI.



18 Letters

One could argue that the entire Zodiac mystery comes down to a group of 18
seemingly random letters at the end of The Cryptogram.

EEBBEEOORRIIEETTEEMMEETTHHHHPPIITTII

If you Google those 18 letters, you will be escorted to various "Zodiac
killer"-related sites, most of which simply report that the passage was found
at the end of the first Zodiac killer cipher, some of which actually attempt to
decipher it . . . or at least, make the first rudimentary steps toward a
solution. Let&#8217;s therefore make some basic assumptions about it:

1, That the Zodiac killer might sign the message with an anagram of his own
name is perfectly reasonable. For example, one group of
&#8220;Zodiologists&#8221; believes the Zodiac killer was also The Unabomber.
They believe the 18 letters convert to his name (including his middle initial):

TTHHEEOODDOORREE JJ.. KKAACCZZYYNNSSKKII

2, The idea that the letters at the end simply fill out the grid is also
reasonable.

I believe that, like all messages from the Zodiac killer, there was a dual
purpose to those 18 letters. The sudden intrusion, following 390 characters
that make some sort of sense, of 18 letters that don&#8217;t, may serve as the
most blatant indicator that what the reader assumed WAS a solution WASN&#8217;T
a solution. It also follows that the perfect misdirection would be to have the
public breathlessly read the apparent solution, then dismiss it because it
contained no significant information, only to have the significant information
hidden underneath.

There&#8217;s a term for this in the world of cryptography. It&#8217;s called a
Two-Step Cipher.
And the 18 letters are a blinking neon sign advertising its presence.


Final Message

Why go to the trouble of composing a multiple substitution cipher which has a
straightforward--if anticlimactic--solution, and then dividing it into three
parts and mailing it to three newspapers in the metropolitan area with as much
menacing fanfare as you can drum up . . . if you&#8217;re going to leave 18
letters at the end that don&#8217;t mean anything?

EEBBEEOORRIIEETTEEMMEETTHHHHPPIITTII

Obviously, you wouldn&#8217;t want to do that. So we have to assume, unless the
Zodiac killer was just &#8220;haveing some fun&#8221; with us (as he did at the
phone booth with the Vallejo cop), that The 18 Letters are perhaps even more
significant than anything else he&#8217;s told us.

The odd thing about The 18 Letters is that they&#8217;re designed to mean
nothing on the surface--their apparent lack of meaning is itself a clue--but
beneath the surface, they reveal the ultimate ends of The Zodiac Project.

The 18 Letters are meant, first of all, to indicate that what follows The
Cryptogram will not be a superficially straightforward message as the first 390
characters are. In other words, they are a blatant indication that what I said
in the previous chapter is true, that The Cryptogram is a two-step cipher. Any
attempt to solve it using conventional methods will eventually break down, and
leave you with an inane message which seems to say very little.

This essentially prepares the way for The 340-Character Cipher, which never had
a straightforward solution . . . and wasn&#8217;t even meant to be deciphered.

I will discuss The 340 when we get to it. For now, let&#8217;s decipher The 18
Letters.


Three Sections

And now, as we used to say back in the &#8216;50s, the $64,000 Question:

What do The 18 Letters at the end of The Cryptogram really mean?

EEBBEEOORRIIEETTEEMMEETTHHHHPPIITTII

Okay, this is a mystery that&#8217;s lasted 40 years. My high school class
didn&#8217;t even wait that long to hold its 40th reunion! It&#8217;s time
somebody solved this thing!

And no, it&#8217;s NOT an anagram of the killer&#8217;s name.

The 18 Letters come at the end of the Zodiac killer&#8217;s very first cipher.
They tell you what&#8217;s going to happen at the end of The Zodiac Project.

EEBBEEOORRIIEETTEEMMEETTHHHHPPIITTII

Like The Cryptogram itself, I&#8217;m going to divide the 18 Letters into three
parts, but in this case they&#8217;re not equal:

EE BBEEOORRIIEETT EEMMEETTHHHHPPIITTII
11 77 1100

There are three sections but only two significant expressions. Note,
incidentally, that the final two sections add up to 17, and represent the same
number of stab wounds administered to Bryan Hartnell (7) and Cecelia Ann
Shepard (10) at Lake Berryessa a couple of months later.

And no, that&#8217;s NOT a coincidence.


First Letter

EE
00

The initial E is actually just a place-holder, though it may also be intended
to provide symmetry with the final Morse/binary character (a zero). Remember,
The Cryptogram, once its three parts were put together, consisted of 24 lines
of 17 characters apiece.

In the cipher text of The Cryptogram, this first character is the last symbol
at the end of line 23. It is character 17 of line 23. Since we know that the
fundamental design of The Zodiac Project is a dichotomy of 23/23, a closing
message that begins at the very end of Line 23 would seem appropriate,
particularly since we're dealing with someone who led a normal life for his
first 23 years, and then intended to be a notorious killer for his remaining 23
years. There has to be a connection, however brief, to that first half of his
life, so that we're aware of the dichotomy.

Note, also, that this symbol occurs immediately following the word

AAFFTTEERRLLIIFFEE..

If the Zodiac Project&#8217;s fundamental design element is symmetry, then a
message that concerns events at the end of his life would be appropriate
following the word AFTERLIFE, correct?


Next Seven Letters

Let&#8217;s look at the second section of the message:

BB EE OO RR II EE TT
11000000 00 111111 001100 0000 00 11

110000 00 0011 11

DD EE AA TT ((HH))
110000 00 0011 11 ((00000000))

The Zodiac killer sometimes used shortened forms of his favorite Morse/binary
expressions; I think this is the only example I cite in this book, but
I&#8217;m calling attention to it because it&#8217;s crucial to the reading.
The justification for using any such shortened form is that what follows it are
binary zeroes, which are just two-multipliers. In other words, eliminate all
trailing zeroes and you have the Morse/binary &#8220;root&#8221; of the word.

DEATH isn&#8217;t used in its normal Morse/binary form (10000110000) because
the Zodiac killer wants it to overlap with another expression in binary math:

BB EE OO RR II EE TT
11000000 00 111111 001100 0000 00 11

1100000000 111111 001100 0000 00 11

11111100110000000011 == 992299

So--long story short--the first of two messages is:

BBEEOORRIIEETT == DDEEAATTHH//992299


DEATH 929

Anyone familiar with the Zodiac killer should know what DEATH means by now, but
what does &#8216;929&#8217; mean? Is it a date, or a time? If &#8216;929&#8217;
were a date, 9-29, it would be September 29th, which is the day on the Catholic
Calendar reserved for St. Michael, Michaelmas. Since our suspect&#8217;s first
name is Michael, that might indicate we&#8217;re on the right track. However,
for a killer who draws designs on USGS quadrangles, 929 seems more likely to be
a destination than a date or time--Highway 929 to Hell.

DDEEAATTHH//992299really means&&##88222200;;DDeeaatthh iinn RRoooomm 992299,, MMIITT TToowweerr&&##88222211;;..

And yes, I&#8217;m talking about the same MIT Tower featured so prominently in
Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s Progressive Architecture article.



Like a railroad track, a train of thought connecting Riverside to The Terminus
Event, and scheduling a final stop at The MIT Tower, is another example of
temporal symmetry.
What you see at The Beginning, you see at The End.



Final Ten Letters

Now let&#8217;s look at the 3rd section:

EE MM EE TT HH HH PP II TT II
00 1111 00 11 00000000 00000000 00111100 0000 11 0000

Although I&#8217;m expressing the Morse code values here with binary digits
(instead of dots and dashes), I&#8217;m going to translate this passage using
straightforward Morse redivision, except for the final binary zero.

Does the reader understand what I mean by redivision?
If not, here&#8217;s an example, in English, from my childhood:

There was a local Pittsburgh kid&#8217;s show back in the late 50s or early 60s
called The Paul Shannon Show, which featured shorts by The Three Stooges and a
character who resembled Claude Rains in The Invisible Man, with airplane
goggles and a trench coat. The character&#8217;s name was Nosmo King, and
between shorts the character would be seen sneaking onto the set and scrawling
the message NOSMO WAS HERE on a wall. I suppose the message was supposed to be
subliminal, but it wasn&#8217;t until I was in my 30s that I finally realized

NNOOSSMMOO KKIINNGGwas actuallyNNOO SSMMOOKKIINNGG!!

It&#8217;s the same set of letters in the same sequence, but divided
differently, as a result of which, you get a completely different message.
That&#8217;s all we&#8217;re doing with Morse redivision; the same sequence,
but divided differently so that it spells something completely different.

EE MM EE TT HH HH PP II TT II
00 1111 00 11 00000000 00000000 00111100 0000 11 0000

0011 1100 110000 0000 000000 00 00 111100 00 001100 00
AA NN DD II,, SS EE EE GG EE RR ((xx22))

So the 3rd expression is:

EEMMEETTHHHHPPIITTII == AANNDD II,, SSEEEEGGEERR ((xx22))

The (x2) is there after SEEGER because there&#8217;s a trailing 0 after the
SEEGER digits, and trailing 0s in binary math are two-multipliers.



Rendezvous With Death

AANNDD II,, SSEEEEGGEERR ((xx22)) is yet another literary reference.

Alan Seeger was an American poet born in 1888. Like Michael O&#8217;Hare, he
was born in New York City, and like Michael O'Hare, he went to Harvard. Unlike
Michael O&#8217;Hare, he fought and died in WWI and was buried in a mass grave
in France. Alan Seeger&#8217;s nephew is the folk singer Pete Seeger, who wrote
&#8220;Where Have All The Flowers Gone?&#8221;, an anti-war song about soldiers
dying for nothing.

Alan Seeger&#8217;s most famous poem was also JFK&#8217;s favorite, the
appropriately (for both men) fatalistic &#8220;I Have A Rendezvous With
Death&#8221;. Because the poem figures so prominently at this point in the
Zodiac killer literature, I&#8217;m going to quote the entire thing:

SEEGER

I believe the Zodiac killer is referring to the beginning of Line 23 (of all
lines!) when he says AND I, SEEGER. Note, incidentally, the symmetry in a
message that begins at the end of one Line 23 (the last character of The
Cryptogram's next-to-last line), and ends at the beginning of another Line 23
(the first character of the Seeger poem's next-to-last line). In other words,
the source for the allusion is bracketed by two 23s.

There can be no mistake about his intention.

AAnndd II ttoo mmyy pplleeddggeedd wwoorrdd aamm ttrruuee,,
II sshhaallll nnoott ffaaiill tthhaatt rreennddeezzvvoouuss..

I. e., the Zodiac killer has a rendezvous with death.
At a specific time, on a specific day.
And he intends to go out with a very big bang!

The police and public only saw the preliminary solution of a two-step cipher,
and decided that the Zodiac killer was playing some silly game with them. The
correct, second-step solution shows that he is deadly serious.

SSeeeeggeerr ((xx22))

As it happens, Alan Seeger was born on 73rd Street in NYC. Remember the
trailing binary zero after his name? 73rd Street (times two) equals 146. Since
&#8216;146&#8217; is the last thing he says in The Cryptogram, the reader may
rest assured that &#8220;146&#8221; is his final destination.

But wait--he intends DEATH in Room 929 of The MIT Tower?

And then schedules a rendezvous with DEATH at &#8220;146&#8221;?

If you can&#8217;t be in two places at once, how can you die in two places?

I will address this issue in The April 1970 Letters. But suffice it to say that
if the chief design element of The Zodiac Project is symmetry, where everything
happens in twos, and the project will come to an end with a very big bang in
1989, then logically that end would come in not one, but two, places.



Anagrams?

Meanwhile, to those of you who were disappointed when I said that The 18
Letters were NOT an anagram of the killer&#8217;s name, do what the Zodiac
killer suggests and cheer up! The Zodiac killer DID spell out his name . . .
just not in The Cryptogram.

He did it in a much more prominent place.

All right, I&#8217;ll give you a hint. There&#8217;s something he&#8217;s doing
here in The Cryptogram cover letters that doesn&#8217;t make any sense, if you
think about it. In fact, he&#8217;s about to risk arrest at a crime scene in
the very near future, just to cover up the fact that he&#8217;s spelling out
his name.

I&#8217;ll give you another hint. It&#8217;s the first thing I ever noticed
about the Zodiac murders, and I noticed it in 1986, long before I suspected
Gareth Penn of being involved. It&#8217;s the thing that made me think other
people following the case just weren&#8217;t paying attention. So--if
you&#8217;re paying attention, see if you can find it before I show it to you!



18 Letters Review

Although the solution to the mystery of The 18 Letters isn&#8217;t as
straightforward as some people might have liked&#8212;it isn&#8217;t an anagram
of the killer&#8217;s name&#8212;it&#8217;s also not at all complicated.
