After writing three editions of my book in 1990, another in 1991, and another
in 1993, I decided in 1994 to write a shorter (1993 = 380 pages, 1994 = 218
pages), more streamlined, and MUCH less cryptographic edition in 1994.

This is a book I wrote 18 1/2 years ago and, because I took the cryptography
out, it isn't that much different from the website edition except for making
fewer points, and not having as interesting a presentation. I was surprised to
see that I still thought that the NYC Zodiac might be the same as the SF Zodiac
in 1994; I knew I suggested that in the 1990 editions, but thought I'd dropped
it by 1994. Again, as I've said many times, my theory hasn't changed in the
past 22 years, except for the addition of Hugh Penn as a conspirator between
the 1991 and 1993 books, but I've felt differently about some of the details. I
still think the 1993 edition is the best of the bound books, and contains by
far the most information.

Notes on the 1994 edition:

PPaaggee iiii: the money-back guarantee. My books were never for sale, and when
people requested a copy, I just sent them one free of charge. I obviously
considered the possibility of selling them at some point to recoup some of the
money printing them was costing me, but it never actually came to that.

PPaaggee 55: I&#8217;m surprised I took the Isobel Watson attack so seriously by
1994; again, I know I wrote about it in 1990 but didn&#8217;t expect it to be
in the 1994 edition.

PPaaggee 2255: I think O&#8217;Hare was actually teaching at The Goldman School by
the fall of 1991, and he specifies 1991 in his Washington Monthly article
(without somehow mentioning my own role in his abrupt career move).

PPaaggee 2299: Going by the dates of the Zodiac&#8217;s follow-up letter (November 9,
1969) and Donald Fouke&#8217;s &#8220;scratch&#8221; (which I believe was
written either on the 12th or 13th), Fouke didn&#8217;t realize it was the
Zodiac he talked to until a month after the incident, and his writing of the
&#8220;scratch&#8221; was motivated by a need to deny the encounter after the
Zodiac made it public. Just in case Mike Rodelli is reading this, let me repeat
my contention here that Donald Fouke is A LYING SACK OF SHIT!

Parenthetically, I just read last night where Mike Rodelli filed some posts on
ZK.com after I officially stopped posting over there on my birthday (April
29th), on the subject of which of William Crow&#8217;s accounts of the Lake
Herman Road incident is more reliable (1968 or 2004). Rodelli is one of the
very best researchers associated with the Zodiac case, but his handling of
eyewitness testimony is &#8220;a head-scratcher&#8221;. Mike seems to think
that a witness is either 100% right or his testimony should be thrown out;
also, that his first account must always be given greater credence than any
follow-up account.

I prefer not to take a hard line with eyewitness accounts, because I believe if
a half-dozen of us Zodiac researchers all witnessed the same incident, we would
each be right about some things and wrong about others. I&#8217;ve cited David
Belin&#8217;s book about the JFK assassination, where he points out that
witnesses in most murder cases tend to be wrong about some details even if the
bulk of their testimony is accurate; therefore, to reject a witness account
just because the witness was wrong about this or that detail is shortsighted.

I prefer to look at ALL the eyewitness accounts and then try to reconstruct
what happened as if I were putting a puzzle together, using some pieces which
fit the overall picture, and rejecting what doesn&#8217;t fit. Rodelli likes
William Crow&#8217;s 1968 account, as given in the police report, because that
account more closely fits Rodelli&#8217;s preconception of who the assailant
was. The problem with the 1968 account is that it has the incident happening
between 9:30pm and 10pm; two witnesses have the light-colored Impala already
parked in the turnout by that time (Frank Gasser at 9pm, and Bingo Wesher at
10pm). Mind you, I believe the incident took place, but Crow has to be wrong
about the time&#8212;it more likely happened prior to 9pm, before the other
witnesses showed up.

PPaaggee 4433: The Zodiac more likely used a .22 handgun on Lake Herman Road, since
it would have been easier to wield in tight quarters and could accept a
flashlight attachment. I was schooled by Smithy on this point, so for once I'm
not expecting any flak from ZKF about it.

PPaaggee 6655: The &#8220;detective&#8221; was actually the late, not great Fred
Shirasago, who was at a bar when I talked to him. I called his office, and they
had me call his favorite bar (shades of Paul Avery in the Fincher movie).
Michael O'Hare praises Freddie in his Washington Monthly article, which all by
itself should make O'Hare a Zodiac suspect.

PPaaggee 8833: Maggie Koerth-Baker of Boing Boing recently regurgitated (in June of
this year) the oft-repeated myth that Michael O&#8217;Hare wasn&#8217;t even in
California during the Zodiac period. Guess again. O&#8217;Hare has never denied
working there during that time, and in fact admits it in the Boston Herald
piece. Additionally, ADL was acutely aware of the connection between Forest
Pines and the Zodiac case, since the police immediately contacted them when
they got the card. Captain Roy Conway of Vallejo PD told me twenty years ago
that every police agency with a Zodiac case was ALL OVER the condo link, and
looked for Donna Lass&#8217;s body where the punched hole on the card seemed to
be. The idea that the connection between the mailing and the condo project is
this farfetched theory is just hilarious; the police thought of it almost two
decades before I did.

PPaaggee 8855: We obviously are NOT to believe The Confession Letter; Cheri Bates
never made it to The RCC Library that night.

PPaaggee 8888: The reason O&#8217;Hare was not chased from Cal-Berkeley by the
arrival of my book, as he had been from Harvard, was that he&#8217;d had time
to prepare his colleagues for it in advance. Whereas the book mailing in
Cambridge caught him with his pants down.

PPaaggee 8899: The Ted Bundy kidnapping trial, which was the first charge he was
brought up on; Ted opted for trial by judge, since he&#8217;d gotten too much
publicity pre-trial to risk a jury of his peers.

PPaaggeess 113366--113377: To be clear, 117DEG 23&#8217; W/33DEG 58&#8217; N are the
coordinates of Riverside City College, not specifically of the murder location.
The Zodiac uses his geodesic locators to indicate general areas in which his
murders will take place: Lake Herman Road, Blue Rock Springs Park, Portsmouth
Square Park. As Mike Butterfield himself has admitted, if you allow for the
north leg of The Mt. Diablo Radian to pass through BRSP, and not the specific
location of Darlene Ferrin&#8217;s murder, the murders ARE connected by the
radian (if about 1 degree off, on average, for the various specific sites).

PPaaggee 115588--115599: I was surprised to see that Gareth Penn actually mentions the two
23s in The Progressive Architecture article in a letter to the FBI from the
early 1980s, recently linked on ZK.com. Of course, he doesn&#8217;t mention The
Terminus.

PPaaggee 118877--118888: Gareth Penn gives July 25, 1969 as the postmark of The Cryptogram
cover letters, so I took his word for it in 1994. It wasn&#8217;t until I saw
the envelopes online that I realized they were postmarked July 31, 1969. Having
said that, I still think the 666/999 insight is the reason he intentionally
misreported the postmark in TTiimmeess 1177. Yet another example of Gareth Penn
getting a fact wrong that he could only have missed on purpose.

PPaaggee 221111: I no longer believe Michael O&#8217;Hare had anything to do with the
NYC Zodiac murders, but in 1994 I considered it a strong possibility. In my
defense I&#8217;ll point out that serial killers, however sophisticated they
may be, tend not to stop killing until they&#8217;re stopped by law
enforcement.
