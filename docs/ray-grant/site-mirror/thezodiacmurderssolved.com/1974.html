<br />
<b>yours truley <br />
<br />
a friend<br />
<br />
a citizen<br />
<br />
the red phantom</b><br />
<br />
. . . what are we to make of them?<br />
<br />
If he&#8217;s so intent on telling us who he is, in his every act as the Zodiac, why would he suddenly begin intentionally presenting himself as someone else?<br />
<br />
Granted, his ruse was half-hearted. Plus there&#8217;s a &#8220;scoreboard&#8221; on the bottom of The Exorcist Letter, and the envelope includes his real signature phrase, &#8220;Please Rush To Editor&#8221;, so we knew who it REALLY was all along.<br />
<br />
Still . . . why even attempt to suggest that someone else is writing to us?<br />
<br />
Are the 1974 letters some sort of self-parody?<br />
<br />
It seems so strange for him to leave the stage for three years, and then return, for six months, speaking in a (nominally) new voice.<br />
<br />
It seems somehow self-defeating, after all the trouble he&#8217;s gone to.<br />
<br />
Plus, all four of the letters are about current events, or at least things that are going on in the popular culture.<br />
<br />
None of them is about the Zodiac murders, though they are about death, and revolutionary violence, and serial murderers . . . and finally a very odd letter at the end about a columnist.<br />
<br />
I suspect that the 1974 Zodiac letters, though not quite self-parody, were intended as a broad hint&#8212;as broad as the &#8216;Z&#8217; drawn by their postmark locations&#8212;that the Zodiac is someone else in real life.<br />

Someone, to use his own phrase, &#8220;entirle different&#8221;.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Gaps Between Events</font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
There is a gap of almost three years between The Lake Tahoe Card of March 22, 1971 and The Exorcist Card of January 29, 1974.<br />
<br />
For the last 37 years, people have believed there must have been some logistical reason for the gaps between Zodiac events.<br />
<br />
Did the Zodiac leave the area and then come back?  If you&#8217;ve gotten this far in the book, you know the Zodiac never did ANYTHING for conventional reasons.<br />
<br />
Remember, I said that the Lake Herman Road murders (December 20, 1968), occur 782 DAYS after the Cheri Bates murder (October 30, 1966).<br />
<br />
<b>782 = 2 x 23 (the Terminus) x 17 </b><br />
<br />
<b>Times 17</b> is the title of Gareth Penn&#8217;s book.<br />
<br />
Let&#8217;s assume that the gaps between events aren&#8217;t there because of any logistical obstacles the Zodiac faced, but because he was spelling something out with them. <br />
<br />
The Zodiac Project begins in 1966.<br />
<br />
It continues more or less unabated until 1971.<br />
<br />
Then there&#8217;s a three-year gap to 1974.<br />
<br />
And the project is scheduled to end in 1989.<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>1966     1971     1974     1989</b><br />
<br />
<br />
So let&#8217;s look at some possible combinations of those gaps:<br />
<br />
<br />
<b>1966-1971                      1971-1989<br />
<br />
</b><br />
5 years,                          followed by 18 years<br />
<br />
5th letter <b>E</b>                     18th letter <b>R</b><br />
<br />
<br />
<b>1966-1974                      1974-1989<br />
<br />
</b><br />
8 years,                          followed by 15 years<br />
<br />
8th letter <b>H</b>                    15th letter <b>O</b><br />
<br />
<br />
Note that this is the same as the gun numbers sequence already alluded to.<br />
<br />
The Zodiac used a <b>22</b>, <b>9</b>, <b>45</b>, and <b>38</b>.<br />
<br />
The sequence in the backward alphabet was <b>E</b>, <b>R</b>, <b>H</b>, and <b>O</b>.<br />
<br />
In other words, letters 5 +18 (the two Vallejo murder events), then 8 +15, (Lake Berryessa and Presidio Heights) with each pair adding up to 23.<br />
<br />
Note, finally, that the Zodiac makes sure he uses only the four &#8220;canonical&#8221; Zodiac events to spell this sequence out!<br />
<br />
This is yet another example of an unexplained Zodiac event (or in this case, a gap in events) at which the so-called researchers on the case throw up their hands.<br />
<br />
What other possible explanation could there be?<br />
<br />
Was the Zodiac in jail? If so, apparently they didn&#8217;t bother to book him and compare his fingerprints with those of the most notorious serial killer of the 20th century.  Of course, they DID compare Arthur Leigh Allen's fingerprints with the Zodiac's, and he's still considered a suspect!<br />
<br />
Was he in a mental institution? If so, he must have signed himself in, right? Otherwise, he&#8217;d have to have been arrested and processed, which is something that happens when idiosyncrasy crosses over into eccentricity, and then finally crosses the line into public nuisance. <br />
<br />
Maybe he was just . . . &#8220;away&#8221;?<br />
<br />
If these half-assed excuses for real research interest the reader, he&#8217;s welcome to visit all the other Zodiac websites.<br />
<br />
If not, I think it&#8217;s fair to ASSUME that a killer so intent on getting his message out that he threatens kill rampages if his notes don&#8217;t show up on the front page, and makes phone calls to police in the aftermath of his murders, would probably NOT let three years go by without a peep out of him . . . and then write pseudonymously.<br />
<br />
Unless, of course, he did that to send ANOTHER message.<br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Found Poems</font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
As has been noted by others, all the 1974 mailings are pseudonymous.<br />
<br />
That in itself is significant.<br />
<br />
<b>PSeudonymous</b><br />
<br />
After all, Paul Stine is a &#8216;PS&#8217;, and the Zodiac uses postscripts in several letters. But all the 1974 mailings also use material found in the popular culture in much the same manner that artists use such material.<br />
<br />
As John Lennon said of &#8220;Being For The Benefit Of Mr. Kite&#8221;, he did very little to change the lyric.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_for_the_Benefit_of_Mr._Kite%21">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Being_for_the_Benefit_of_Mr._Kite!</a><br />
<br />
Although I knew John Lennon had taken the lyrics from a Victorian poster, since he mentioned it in his Rolling Stone interview back in 1970, I had always assumed John had changed 'somersaults' to 'somersets', but the latter is actually on the poster.<br />
<br />
In any case, I talked about Found Objects earlier as often being the basis for Pop Art.  In literature, these references are sometimes called 'Found Poems'.<br />
<br />

<a href="http://www.foundpoetryreview.com/fall-2011">http://www.foundpoetryreview.com/fall-2011<br />
</a><br />
In the four 1974 mailings, the Zodiac uses<br />
<br />
<br />
1, the Exorcist movie,<br />
<br />
2, the Symbionese Liberation Army,<br />
<br />
3, the Badlands movie, and<br />
<br />
4, the Count Marco column<br />
<br />
<br />
. . . as popular culture reference points to things he&#8217;s doing.<br />
<br />
If you look carefully at that list, you&#8217;ll notice, to cite a device used on standard intelligence tests, that one of the items is different from the other three.<br />
<br />
When we get to that item, we&#8217;ll discuss WHY it&#8217;s different.<br />
<br />
In the meantime, let&#8217;s start chronologically with The Exorcist Letter.<br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Titwillo</font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
I&#8217;ve already discussed several aspects of The Exorcist Letter, which was mailed by the Zodiac killer on January 29, 1974.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/24591864f6af2730df9a083191e6793c_q4bt.gif"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
1, the phrase &#8216;Me &#8211; 37&#8217; means &#8220;I am pi.&#8221;<br />
<br />
2, The Zodiac references a character who can move her head 180&#176;, because 180&#176; is a metaphor for a secret identity, which serial killers, as well as comic book superheroes, have.<br />
<br />
3, the quotation from The Mikado is another reference to pi, because the premier of the Gilbert &amp; Sullivan musical was on March 14th (3-14), 1885.<br />
<br />
<br />
Now, note the use of the word TITWILLO<br />
<br />
&nbsp; <b>T &nbsp;&nbsp;    I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     W &nbsp; &nbsp;    I &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;     L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      O<br />
20 + 9 + 20 + 23 + 9 + 12 + 12 + 15 = 120</b> (alphabet numbers)<br />
<br />
There are 3 TITWILLOs.<br />
<br />
3 x 120 is 360 . . . so he&#8217;s formed a circle.<br />
<br />
Note, however, that if the final W is left on TITWILLO, it adds up to 143.<br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 16px;">&nbsp; <b>T &nbsp;&nbsp;    I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      T&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     W &nbsp; &nbsp;    I &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;     L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;      O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; W<br />
20 + 9 + 20 + 23 + 9 + 12 + 12 + 15&nbsp; +&nbsp; 23 = 143</b> (alphabet numbers)</font><br />
<br />
143, or 1-43, is yet another way of saying January, 1943, our suspect&#8217;s MOB.<br />
<br />
So the use of, and even the misspelling of, the word TITWILLO evokes both circles and 1-43.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Linda Blair</font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
The star of <b>The Exorcist</b>&#8212;the demon from Hell&#8212;is Linda Blair.<br />
<br />
<b>Linda Blair</b><br />
<br />
<b>L&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; B<br />
12 &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;    2</b><br />
<br />
LB is 122. <br />
<br />
Again, remember that nearly every result in The Zodiac Project has to be arrived at in at least two ways, to obey the rule of symmetry.<br />
<br />
Linda Blair is 1-22 by acrostic.<br />
<br />
And the actress Linda Blair was also born on January 22nd (as was Michael O'Hare).<br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">9745/5479</font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
Incidentally, I mention in an earlier edition of this book that Linda Blair was born on January 22, 1959, and thus had just turned 15 a week prior to the mailing of The Exorcist Letter.<br />
<br />
When a person turns fifteen, 75% of the time he&#8217;s 5,479 days old (depending on how many leap year days he&#8217;s accumulated).<br />
<br />
Remember my mentioning Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s age in days at Lake Berryessa?<br />
<br />
He was exactly 9,745 days old on the day of the Lake Berryessa attack.<br />
<br />
So Linda Blair, besides being the star of a movie the Zodiac reviews, at age 15 is 5,479 days old and a mirror-image for Michael O&#8217;Hare at 9,745 days old (at Lake Berryessa).<br />
<br />
Do we notice any other similarities here?<br />
<br />
For instance, that the Zodiac wore a ceremonial costume at Lake Berryessa, and the action central to the movie is a ceremony known in the Catholic Church as an exorcism?<br />
<br />
Again, remember, the Zodiac conspirators could not have known, in 1966, that a movie about exorcism would come out in 1973.  It's simply an example of artists, and I use the term figuratively, using what material is at hand in the popular culture.<br />
<br />
This is in stark contrast with what art was during Dante's time, the (very early) Renaissance.  During the Renaissance, art was intended to present the ideal, and to be self-contained.<br />
<br />
Modern art, as practiced by The New York Group (which included Berta Margoulies), aimed to incorporate contemporary culture (as Warhol and Lichtenstein's Pop Art did, for example), and to frame the intersection between the ideal and reality (in some cases, contrasting the two).   <br />
<br />
More in line with Dante, <b>The Inferno</b> is a kind of subterranean journalism, with the poet a roving (actually revolving) reporter interviewing the various denizens of Hell.<br />
<br />
And <b>The Exorcist</b> contains, at its center, a dialogue between a speaking spirit from Hell and the various characters confronting her.<br />
<br />
The Zodiac does exactly the same thing the Linda Blair character does.<br />
<br />
He brings Hell to Earth.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<font style="font-size: 24px;">SLA</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
The SLA Letter was mailed February 14, 1974, during the national news coverage of The Symbionese Liberation Army, who had kidnapped Patty Hearst and committed various other crimes including bank robberies.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/a98fc3ba39748e9f2ddd509954bf64fb.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
Believe it or not, The SLA Letter brings us all the way back to Dante&#8217;s Inferno.<br />
<br />
A good source for the roots of Old Norse words is <b>The OED</b>.<br />
<br />
<b>The Oxford English Dictionary</b> is archeological.<br />
<br />
For each entry in the dictionary, it cites the first recorded use of the word.<br />
<br />
With &#8216;SLA&#8217;, which the Zodiac correctly identifies as a form of the word &#8216;slay&#8217; (which means &#8216;kill&#8217;--you'd think he'd be an expert on forms of that word), the Zodiac has hit on a word form that originated in the year 1300.<br />
<br />
This is the section of the entry under the 'sla' variant of 'slay' in The Online OED:<br />
<br />
<b>&#946;. north.ME sla, slo.<br />
<font style="font-size: 16px;">a1300 in Old Eng. Misc. 200/5 Loke &#254;at tu ne sla na man.</font><br />
c1325 in G. L. Brook Harley Lyrics (1968) 34 Er &#254;ou me slo.<br />

a1500 (1460) Towneley Plays (1994) I. ii. 22, I will that no man other slo.<br />
</b>
<br />
As you can see, the earliest recorded use of the variant occurred in 1300.<br />
<br />
1300, of course, is also the year of <b>Dante&#8217;s Inferno</b>.<br />
<br />
It begins on Holy Thursday, April 7, 1300&#8212;the last year of the 13th century&#8212;and ends on Easter Sunday, April 10, 1300.<br />
<br />
Ask yourself this question: why would the Zodiac cite THAT particular spelling of &#8216;slay&#8217;?  Obviously, he&#8217;s using what&#8217;s going on in the news at the time to make the reference, but what kind of person would look at the letters S-L-A and then make that sort of connection?<br />
<br />
Presumably, it would be someone who has access to a copy of <b>The OED</b>.<br />
<br />
A scholar, perhaps?<br />
<br />
A career academic?<br />
<br />
Here&#8217;s a line from the Wikipedia entry for <b>Inferno</b> (Dante):<br />
<br />
<b>The poem begins on the day before Good Friday in the year 1300.</b><br />
<br />
Here&#8217;s a segment of the Wikipedia entry for Old Norse:<br />
<br />
<b>Old Norse is a North Germanic language that was spoken by inhabitants of Scandinavia and inhabitants of their overseas settlements during the Viking Age, until about 1300.</b><br />
<br />
Hmmm!<br />
<br />
Now, here&#8217;s a segment of the Wikipedia entry for Gareth Penn:<br />
<br />
<b>Penn graduated from the University of California, Berkeley in 1962 with a Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) in Germanic languages and again in 1965 with an Master of Arts (MA) in Medieval Germanic languages. He received a Master of Library Science (MLS) from U.C. Berkeley in 1971.[2]</b><br />
<br />
Hmmm!<br />
<br />
Maybe I'm naive, but it does seem to me that someone with two degrees in Germanic languages and one in Library Science would be familiar with Old Norse and The OED.<br />
<br />
As I&#8217;ve mentioned elsewhere, I paid a book agent specializing in reference books $150 in 1978 for a copy of the 2nd Edition of <b>Webster&#8217;s International Dictionary</b> (1934). I was one of the hordes of English majors dissatisfied with editor Philip Gove&#8217;s demonic <b>Webster&#8217;s Third International Dictionary</b> (1961), which is a DEscriptive dictionary (the 2nd Edition is PREscriptive). I own a physical copy of every edition of <b>Webster&#8217;s International Dictionary</b>, plus every edition of <b>The Columbia Encyclopedia</b>, plus <b>The Oxford English Dictionary</b> (1989), plus numerous other philological works such as John Simon's <b>Paradigms Lost</b> and Eric Partridge's <b>Origins</b>.  So ordinarily, I don&#8217;t go in for online dictionaries.  The section I've cited can be found in my own physical copy of <b>The OED</b> as well as <b>The Online OED</b>. <br />
<br />
The advantage of <b>The Online OED</b> is that people can look up the entry at their computers.  I&#8217;d tell Zodiac message board posters to look up the entry themselves, but that would cost them at least $29.95 for a month&#8217;s subscription to <b>The Online OED</b>.  I just hope the person looking up the entry isn&#8217;t Ed Neil, because Ed has this tendency to look up terms such as &#8216;terracina&#8217;, spend a couple minutes finding ONE example of that term on Wikipedia, see that it&#8217;s different from what Ray Grant says it is, and then jump up, tipping his chair over, and start bellowing about the &#8220;gem&#8221; that he&#8217;s found that proves Ray Grant doesn&#8217;t know what he&#8217;s talking about.<br />
<br />
You&#8217;re going to have to dig deeper, Ed.  If you want to sit in on my class, even with the Halloween mask on, fine, but you&#8217;re going to have to do your homework.<br />
<br />
And I mean ALL of it. <br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<font style="font-size: 24px;">Badlands 1</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
The Badlands Card was mailed May 8, 1974:<br />
<br />
<b>Sirs -- I would like to expression my <strike>consternt</strike> consternation concerning your poor taste + lack of sympathy for the public, as evidenced by your running of the ads for the movie "Badlands," featuring the blurb: "In 1959 most people were killing time. Kit + Holly were killing people." In light of recent events, this kind of murder-glorification can only be deplorable at best (not that glorification of violence was ever justifiable) why don't you show some concern for public sensibilities + cut the ad?</b><br />
<br />
<b>A citizen</b><br />
<br />
Let's quickly note that the message is in perfect, even stuffy, English, and the one misspelling in it is crossed out.<br />
<br />
We know that a genius can pretend to be semi-literate.  But can a semi-literate PRETEND to be literate and use such complex sentence structure?<br />
<br />
In February 1974, the Zodiac writes The SLA Letter, which is about the meaning of a word variant cited in <b>The Oxford English Dictionary</b>.<br />
<br />
Here, in May 1974, the Zodiac writes a letter in self-conscious, fastidiously-phrased English.<br />
<br />
This is the same man who draws workable bomb diagrams in freehand, tapes a penlight to the barrel of his rifle so he can shoot victims on a pitch dark road, brags about using airplane glue to mask his fingerprints, and twice uses a term, RADIANS, which tells us his math education at least extended to trigonometry classes.<br />
<br />
The people who post on Zodiac message boards believe Cheri Bates was in The RCC Library the night she was murdered.  She was there for 2 hours and 40 minutes writing in her notebook, checking the card catalogue, checking the shelves and charging out books amid the 65 staff and students who were there that night . . . and no one saw her.  An outgoing, pretty blonde cheerleader didn't talk to anyone all night, and no one talked to her.<br />
<br />
There may be intelligent life on Earth; I don&#8217;t advise looking for it on Zodiac websites.  In any case, I submit, to the non-"Zodiac hobbyists" out there, that The Badlands Card pretty much dispenses with the notion that the Zodiac was semi-literate.  His misspellings and faulty grammar were a symptom of having to construct an undertext.<br />
<br />
I suspect that's why The Exorcist Letter contains a Zodiac scoreboard at the bottom, but the other three letters from 1974 were all "signed" with pseudonyms (a friend, a citizen, the red phantom).  In other words, The Exorcist Letter read like a Zodiac letter, and the other three didn't, so he "pretended" it wasn't him, like a hold-up man wearing Groucho glasses.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<font style="font-size: 24px;">Badlands 2</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
Of all the Zodiac mailings, one could make the case that The Badlands Card was the most artistically complex, taking a current movie and turning it into a self-identifier.<br />
<br />
Let&#8217;s start with the movie itself.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s based on the story of spree killer Charles Starkweather, but is actually fictional.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/d4ca6a8cc52adce69dabecc60139c693.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
Starkweather's spree took place mostly in Lincoln, Nebraska; Dick Cavett and his family knew Starkweather as a garage mechanic who seemed normal and friendly.<br />
<br />
The events of <b>Badlands</b> take place in South Dakota, and Badlands itself is a national park located in South Dakota.<br />
<br />
In fact, Mt. Rushmore is located in The Black Hills Forest, just northwest of The Badlands.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/f6f23687275d53a5eed51e2083745598.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
That Mt. Rushmore is near Badlands National Park is itself suggestive.<br />
<br />
As I&#8217;ve said, The Zodiac Project was planned by four people: sculptor Berta Margoulies, Michael O'Hare, Gareth Penn, and Hugh Penn.<br />
</font><br />
<div style="text-align: center;">
<img alt=""  src="images/f739582120fa3ea7e98300801b6faa67.png"  /><br />

</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
I regret I have no photo of Hugh Penn; let's imagine that his face was blasted off the mountainside like the original carving of Thomas Jefferson, which was to the LEFT of George Washington.  In any case, the proximity of Mt. Rushmore is merely suggestive.<br />
<br />
I just stumbled across a photo of Hugh Penn on OPORD, the posting circa 2007:<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/8d12fa55e471bd222b97292757240c0f.png"  /><br />
<br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
But the reference to Badlands is much more specific.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<font style="font-size: 24px;">Badlands 3</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
The Badlands are famous for one thing.<br />
<br />
Extreme shifts of temperature.<br />
<br />
If the reader will go with me to <b>The Information Please Almanac </b>(InfoPlease.com), there&#8217;s a list of the most extreme temperature shifts ever recorded.<br />
<br />
By the way, it&#8217;s interesting that only Information Please has this info.<br />
<br />
Information Please, by acrostic, is I-P, which is P-I backward.<br />
<br />
Two of these extreme shifts happened on one day in history.<br />
<br />
One was a sudden increase from -4&#176; to 45&#176; in two minutes, recorded at Spearfish, SD from 7:30am to 7:32am.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005317.html">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005317.html</a><br />
<br />
Then the temperature rose another 9&#176; over the next two hours.<br />
<br />
Then, at 9:30am, the temperature dropped back from 54&#176; to -4&#176;.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005319.html">http://www.infoplease.com/ipa/A0005319.html</a><br />
<br />
Significantly, the drop was 58 degrees.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<b>Z&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; O&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; D&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A&nbsp;&nbsp; C<br />
26 + 15 + 4 + 9 + 1 + 3 = 58</b><br />
<br />
What date did all this happen?<br />
<br />
That's right--Friday, January 22, 1943.<br />
<br />
If you've been paying attention, you'll recognize that as Michael O'Hare's DOB.<br />
<br />
Which still leaves us with two questions: <br />
<br />
1, Since no one, no matter how bright, could be expected to make that connection . . . how on Earth did Ray Grant manage to make it?<br />
<br />
I cannot tell a lie: It was an answer on Jeopardy one night, and seeing the date made me grab for my almanac.  Note that another place with extremes in temperature would be Hell.<br />
<br />
Oh.<br />
<br />
2, What clue was implied in the card?<br />
<br />
&#8220;Stark weather in The Badlands.&#8221;<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<font style="font-size: 24px;">Count Marco 1</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
The Zodiac mailed The Count Marco Card on July 9, 1974.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/f3c75ba3dd94d919b73bc7d3c9cb73a9.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
Once again, we see that the Zodiac's semi-literacy was just a ruse.<br />
<br />
He not only manages to communicate in correct English, he even copies Marco Spinelli's handwriting (in fact, he even copies it on the envelope)! <br />
<br />
Other than that, I&#8217;m really not sure what he&#8217;s getting at here.<br />
<br />
So let&#8217;s do what the subject implies and count MARCO.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;
<b>M&nbsp;&nbsp;     A&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     R&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    C&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;     O<br />
13 + 1 + 18 + 3 + 15 = 50</b>  (alphabet numbers)<br />
<br />
50 may suggest 50 states, which make up the U. S. A.<br />
<br />
The Zodiac communicates through the U. S. Postal Service, which is federal.<br />
<br />
Plus we now know that The Count Marco Letter was his final mailing.<br />
<br />
So it seems reasonable to assume his point has to do WITH the mailings.<br />
<br />
So . . . why don&#8217;t we count the mailings?<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<font style="font-size: 24px;">Count Marco 2</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
If you count Marco you get 50.<br />
<br />
50 states make up the United States.<br />
<br />
And the Zodiac communicated through the federal postal system.<br />
<br />
And this was his last letter.<br />
<br />
And, by my count, he&#8217;s now sent 26 letters.<br />
<br />
Remember, The Desk Poem and Lake Berryessa car door message don&#8217;t count, because they didn&#8217;t go through The U. S. Post Office/Postal Service (it became the Postal Service in 1970).<br />
<br />
Here&#8217;s the tally, counting all copies of letters sent:<br />

<br />

<br />
Would it then be fair to assume that the Zodiac is using the alphabet itself as a numerical code?<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<font style="font-size: 24px;">Phantom 1</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
Sometimes I think I'm the only one working on this case.<br />
<br />
In a sense, I am . . . but not in the sense I mean right now.<br />
<br />
What I'm saying right now is:<br />
<br />
Look, I know my CONCLUSIONS are different from everyone else's.<br />
<br />
But my PERCEPTIONS also seem to be different from everyone else's.<br />
<br />
Let's use The Count Marco Letter as an example.<br />
<br />
Everyone else who writes about this letter talks about The Red Phantom.<br />
<br />
But the Zodiac doesn't SAY "Red Phantom"!<br />
<br />
Let's go back to The Mt. Diablo Letter for a moment to illustrate the concept:<br />
<br />
Remember what I said about all the speculation about "Magnetic North" on the Phillips 66 map?<br />
<br />
The Zodiac never SAYS "Magnetic North"; he says "Mag. N.".<br />
<br />
When you're dealing with someone who throws as much misdirection at you as the Zodiac does, you have to pay attention to WHAT HE ACTUALLY SAYS.<br />
<br />
And, I repeat: The Zodiac never actually SAYS "Red Phantom".<br />
<br />
Here's what he says:<br />
<br />
<b>the Red Phantom<br />
(red with rage)</b><br />
<br />
If I call myself "Red Ray Grant" (red with rage) . . . then I'm NOT really calling myself "Red Ray Grant", right?  Because I'm adding, in the parenthesis, that 'red' is a modifier.  So I'm Ray Grant, and I'm RED only because I'm RED with rage.<br />
<br />
So, since the Zodiac calls himself "the Red Phantom", but then adds that he's RED with rage, we can assume that he means to call himself The Phantom, right?<br />
<br />
But who was The Phantom?<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<font style="font-size: 24px;">Phantom 2</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
Who was The Phantom?<br />
<br />
I thought you'd never ask!<br />
<br />
The Phantom was a serial killer who terrorized Texarkana in 1946. <br />
<br />
The Phantom&#8217;s murders are so similar to those of the Zodiac&#8212;in many respects they&#8217;re virtually identical&#8212;that it's impossible (for me at least) to believe he wasn&#8217;t consciously copying them. It seems, in fact, likely that The Phantom inspired the Zodiac. <br />
<br />
Remember, I said the Robert Salem homicide was committed by someone who was consciously copying the Manson family murder of Gary Alan Hinman.  So the notion that the Zodiac based his initial string of murders on those of an earlier serial killer (particularly ones that were committed in &#8217;46, which is, of course, 2 x 23) shouldn&#8217;t surprise us.<br />
<br />
Let&#8217;s do a little thought-experiment here and try to imagine what the Zodiac&#8217;s motivation would be, working backwards.<br />
<br />
He sets out to create a puzzle, which will consist of publicly-committed murders, followed by murders which, though public in the sense of the public&#8217;s being aware of them, are not necessarily recognized as his handiwork, and which he doesn&#8217;t acknowledge (at least, not on the surface of his letters).<br />
<br />
If that&#8217;s his intent, why would he copy someone else?<br />
<br />
Clearly, one would have the most control over the publicity aspect of what you did if you based it on something that had already happened, right?<br />
<br />
You would also be calling attention to your copying of the other case.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<font style="font-size: 24px;">Phantom 3</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
For the moment, let&#8217;s just consider that The Zodiac Project used The Phantom of Texarkana, Texas as its model for the actual murders of the Zodiac killer.<br />
<br />
What might have attracted the planners to that case?<br />
<br />
The Phantom was an unidentified serial killer believed to have committed a series of murders in Texarkana, Texas between February 23 and May 4, 1946. (Wikipedia)<br />
<br />
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Killer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantom_Killer<br />
</a><br />
Immediately we see that the Phantom&#8217;s attacks began on February 23rd of 1946, which has the distinction of completing an equation in Zodiacese:<br />
<br />
<b>February 23, 1946<br />
<br />
2-23 &#8216;46</b>
<b><br />
<br />
2 x 23 = 46</b>
<br />
<br />
The Phantom&#8217;s first attack, on Friday/Saturday, 2/23/46, was in an apparent lovers lane, similar to the attack at Lake Herman Road, except that the two victims, both assaulted, survived.<br />
<br />
<b>The first two victims, Jimmy Hollis and Mary Jeanne Larey, described him as being six feet tall with a white hood mask over his head with holes cut for his eyes and mouth.</b><br />
<br />
Sounds like a primitive version of the costume at Lake Berryessa!<br />
<br />
The second attack occurred exactly a month later, on Saturday, 3/23/46, again in a lovers lane, but this time the victims were discovered dead the next morning. Again, similar to Lake Herman Road, the two victims were apparently forced out of the car and killed twenty feet away with shots to the head, though their bodies were put back inside the car.<br />
<br />
The third pair of lovers lane victims were killed Sunday, 4/14/46 in a place called Spring Lake Park (which sounds like Blue Rock Springs). The man&#8217;s body was found a mile-and-a-half from his car; the woman&#8217;s was found two miles from the car, both in rural surroundings similar to Lake Berryessa.<br />
<br />
On Saturday, 5/4/46, an assailant attacked a farmhouse, shot a man to death and wounded his wife with a .22 semi-automatic, not a .32 pistol as he had used previously. <br />
<br />
On Monday, 5/6/46, a man was found stabbed to death on the railroad tracks north of Texarkana. His body was apparently dragged to where it was found.<br />
<br />
Like the Zodiac, the Phantom had &#8220;broken his pattern&#8221;, and, like the Zodiac, he suddenly stopped killing and was never heard from again.<br />
<br />
Except that relatives of the victims received phone calls in the years following the murders from someone claiming to be the daughter of the killer, apologizing for his deeds.  It should be noted that the main suspect in the case had been jailed on unrelated charges in July, 1946, remained in jail until 1974, and died in 1994.  He had no daughter.<br />
<br />
I realize that at least one book has compared the two cases, but I'm not suggesting that The Phantom was The Zodiac (for one thing, The Phantom sexually assaulted his female victims, and The Zodiac didn't).<br />
<br />
What I AM suggesting is that the Zodiac used The Phantom as his primary model, and that he was pointing that out in The Count Marco Letter . . . in the very last thing he said.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
<font style="font-size: 24px;">PostScript</font></font> <font style="font-size: 24px;">(1978)</font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
And no, the April 1978 letter is NOT a Zodiac letter.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m not accusing anyone here.  I&#8217;ll leave others to jump to whatever conclusions they wish, since the letter&#8217;s not from the Zodiac and therefore doesn&#8217;t concern me.<br />
<br />
By the way, why would the Zodiac say &#8220;that city pig Toschi is good&#8221;?<br />
<br />
Because of the tremendous progress SFPD had made in the case?<br />
<br />
They were breathing right down his neck, right?<br />
<br />
I can prove, cryptographically, that the April 1978 letter isn&#8217;t from the Zodiac. Such proof, however, is beyond the scope of this book, which is to present as simple a solution as possible (and to avoid the detail that&#8217;s to be found in earlier editions of this book).<br />
<br />
But it comes down to this:<br />
<br />
If you convert each Zodiac letter to Morse code and then use your computer&#8217;s search function to look for strings, you find a very significant undertext, usually consisting of literary and classical references, in every single purported Zodiac letter.<br />
<br />
Except for the April 1978 letter, which behaves just like regular text.<br />
<br />
Which is to say, digital strings show up in the undertext about as often as they would in any random passage of text anywhere.<br />
<br />
There&#8217;s a reason for this.<br />
<br />
IT&#8217;S BECAUSE THE PERSON WHO COMPOSED THE 1978 LETTER DIDN&#8217;T KNOW THE ZODIAC LETTERS CONTAINED A CRYPTOGRAPHIC UNDERTEXT.<br />
<br />
Because he wasn&#8217;t the Zodiac.<br />
<br />
The person who composed the 1978 letter probably wouldn&#8217;t know what a cryptographic undertext was, even if you explained it to him.<br />
<br />
In that sense, he has a lot in common with posters on Zodiac message boards.<br />

<font style="font-size: 24px;">Michael O'Hare 1968-1974</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
The last we saw Michael O&#8217;Hare, he was publishing his maiden journal article in Progressive Architecture, March 1967: &#8220;Wind Whistles Through MIT Tower&#8221;.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/59e274ac068126dc67015ec270be08de_dngp.jpg"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
The Zodiac was VERY busy between then and 1974.<br />
<br />
Even at my halting pace, I've already covered the entire span of what the &#8220;hobbyists&#8221; consider to be the Zodiac case:<br />
<br />
<b><u>The Lake Herman Road Murders</u>     to     <u>The Count Marco Letter</u><br />
December 20, 1968 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;                 -&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;               July 9, 1974</b><br />
<br />
Those dates don't even come close to spanning The Zodiac Project.<br />
<br />
Besides the four &#8220;canonical&#8221; murder events (LAKE HERMAN ROAD, BLUE ROCK SPRINGS, LAKE BERRYESSA, and PRESIDIO HEIGHTS), the Zodiac had committed four other murders by 1974 (CHERI BATES, SHELLY HOLMBOE, ROBERT SALEM, and DONNA LASS), and he was by no means finished.<br />
<br />
Still, the reader has to be strolling toward that wind-whipped vestibule of The MIT Tower and wondering just what an academic professional like Michael O&#8217;Hare was up to, while his alter-ego was running amok in The San Francisco Bay Area 1968-1974.<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/018570428626fb992bbfed3f6eee3209_aobb.png"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;">
<br />
What was Michael O'Hare doing, you ask?<br />
<br />
To some extent, you can answer that question by asking yourself where the Zodiac was.<br />
<br />
For example, around midnight on July 4, 1969, Michael O'Hare was in Vallejo, California, pulling into the parking lot of the Blue Rock Springs Golf Course (and grabbing a flashlight and 9mm gun off the seat of his Corvair/Mustang/Impala).<br />
<br />
At 9:45pm or so on October 11, 1969, Michael O'Hare was at the corner of Washington &amp; Cherry Streets in San Francisco, getting out of the back seat of Paul Stine&#8217;s cab (and about to get into the front seat).<br />
<br />
Oh wait . . . you want to know where he was when he WASN&#8217;T appearing in various places and in various guises as the Zodiac?<br />
<br />
In other words . . . you want to know where he was and what he was doing GENERALLY, when he WASN'T gunning down teenagers and offering pregnant women and their babies a lift to the next service station?<br />
<br />
Well, half the answer is straightforward, and I'll be discussing Michael O'Hare's resume, which has been deliberately falsified to cover up his Zodiac activity, in detail momentarily. <br />
<br />
And . . . half the answer may come as a bit of a shock!<br />
<br />
Because Michael O&#8217;Hare told the police who he was.<br />
<br />
The reader thinks I mean, "cryptographically".<br />
<br />
No. I mean he actually TOLD the police who he was.<br />
<br />
Or, at the very least, WHERE they could find him.<br />
<br />
I said this book would appeal to puzzle people.<br />
<br />
There is a clue I&#8217;ve already discussed that was literally handed to every police agency in The San Francisco Bay Area, which would reduce the search for the Zodiac to perhaps a few dozen people, and certainly less than a hundred.<br />
<br />
Once they figured it out, picking Michael O'Hare, the Zodiac killer, from the gallery of potential suspects wouldn&#8217;t have taken very long&#8212;an afternoon&#8217;s work, if that.<br />
<br />
When you consider how much attention police DID pay to that clue, it&#8217;s amazing they didn&#8217;t manage to stumble over him somehow.<br />

On March 22, 1971, the Zodiac mailed The Lake Tahoe Card to The SF Chronicle.<br />
<br />

<br />
Here's a pop quiz for the reader:<br />
<br />
Q: How is The Lake Tahoe Card different from all the other Zodiac letters?<br />
<br />
A: The Lake Tahoe Card is the Zodiac's "signature" mailing.<br />
<br />
I mentioned earlier that I want the reader to view the Zodiac's four ciphers as ONE single cipher.<br />
<br />
Now, I want the reader to look at the Zodiac's 26 mailings as if they were ONE single letter.<br />

<br />
23. The Exorcist Letter</b>
<b><br />
24. The SLA Letter<br />
25. The Badlands Card<br />
26. The Count Marco Letter</b><br />
<br />
Letters 1-5 are the Heading and Greeting of the ONE letter, separated by more than two years from The SF Bay Area letters . . . and Letters 23-26 are PSeudonymous, separated by almost three years from <font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">The SF Bay Area letters</font></font>--they are figuratively and literally PSs.<br />
<br />
Which leaves us Letters 6-22 as the body of the ONE letter.<br />
<br />
When one considers that Letters 21 and 22 are also separated by five months from Letter 20, Letter 21 can be said to be the Closing ("yours truly"), and Letter 22 then becomes the signature of the ONE letter.<br />
<br />
<b>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Letters 1-5: Heading and Greeting<br />
<br />
&nbsp; Letters 6-20: Main body of letter<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Letter 21: Closing<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Letter 22: Signature<br />
<br />
Letters 23-26: PSs</b><br />
<br />
If this view of the letters seems a bit "imaginative", The Lake Tahoe Card nonetheless remains the last mailing in which the Zodiac uses the name 'Zodiac'.&nbsp; The last four letters are effectively PSs, in which he uses signatures other than his own.&nbsp; What precedes the PostScripts in a letter is the signature.<br />
<br />
How is Letter 22 the Zodiac's signature?&nbsp; It's his signature in terms of where it occurs in the overall pattern--it occurs where the signature would normally be.<br />
<br />
That signature letter, The Lake Tahoe Card, is also the one in which he tells us who he is.<br />
<br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Forest Pines</font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
What's so different about The Lake Tahoe Card, you ask?<br />
<br />
The Lake Tahoe Card is the only Zodiac mailing that includes a reference to specific individuals other than the victims themselves, or public people associated with the case (Melvin Belli, Paul Avery, Marco Spinelli), though the card itself was addressed to Paul Avery.&nbsp; The Zodiac mailings are generic in the sense that the killer normally avoids references to local details.&nbsp; He mentions Cheri Jo Bates by name ("Miss Bates"), most likely because he wants to remind us that her name contains that of the founder of the 7th Day Adventist Church (Joseph Bates), the church of the victims at Lake Berryessa.&nbsp; Otherwise, he simply refers to the victims generically.<br />
<br />
In The Lake Tahoe Card, the Zodiac sends an ad for a Lake Tahoe resort condominium, Forest Pines, pasted to the post card.&nbsp; The ad appeared in The SF Chronicle two days before the mailing.&nbsp; Because the condo was in Lake Tahoe, the mailing seemed to acknowledge the kidnapping (and presumed murder) of Donna Lass as a Zodiac crime.<br />
<br />
As Captain Roy Conway told me more than two decades ago, police agencies associated with the Zodiac case spent a tremendous amount of time trying to figure out the precise location of the punched hole in the card as it related to the area around Forest Pines.&nbsp; Believe it or not, the idea that Donna Lass was buried somewhere by the Zodiac, and that it was up to investigators to find that burial location, did not originate with Ray Grant.&nbsp; Police agencies were following that line of thought in the spring of 1971, almost 20 years before I did.&nbsp; Unfortunately, they didn't find Donna Lass anywhere in the vicinity (she was already buried in Portsmouth Square Park).<br />
<br />
</font></font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><img alt=""  src="images/4c46b3ac3bc8643bf5a54491ef57af95_xysq.jpg"  /><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
If Forest Pines wasn't a reference to Donna Lass's burial location, why make it the centerpiece of your last mailing in The Bay Area (until 1974)?&nbsp; It wasn't the last place the victim was seen (the Sahara Hotel was), and it certainly wasn't where she lived.<br />
<br />
Forest Pines was a brand-new condo project; it had just been built when the card was sent.<br />
<br />
So why go to the trouble of cutting out the ad and pasting it onto a post card, along with some cut-out phrases from newspapers?&nbsp; If he's claiming Donna Lass as a victim, as the police obviously believed, why bring in this brand-new building project that had nothing to do with Donna Lass personally?<br />
<br />
Think about what Forest Pines was when that card was sent.&nbsp; It was a resort condo project that was being advertised in the newspaper.&nbsp; It was, for lack of a better term, a commodity.<br />
<br />
Now: What was Michael O'Hare doing in March 1971?<br />
<br />
He was dealing in just that type of commodity.&nbsp; We don't know the exact span of his employment there, but for the year or two prior to that mailing, Michael O'Hare was working at Arthur D. Little in San Francisco, a consulting firm whose purpose was to escort building projects from the planning stage to completion by negotiating the permit process through whatever hurdles, including zoning boards and local politicians, presented themselves.<br />
<br />
If you had a vision that involved putting a building up somewhere in northern California, it was Michael O'Hare's job to turn your dream into reality.<br />
<br />
What's that, you say?&nbsp; That's a connection, but not a specific one?<br />
<br />
Then let's take it a step further.&nbsp; The consulting firm involved in the process with Forest Pines was . . . you guessed it: Arthur D. Little!<br />
<br />
When I called ADL in 1990, the associate I spoke with readily remembered all the hubbub involved in their office's project, Forest Pines, just after that mailing in March 1971.&nbsp; She also remembered Michael O'Hare working there around the same time (though again, we can't be sure of the exact dates of his employment).<br />
<br />
Here's how gullible some people are: Michael O'Hare writes a feature for The Washington Monthly in 2009 in which he points out that<br />
<br />
<b>I spent a summer in San Francisco&#8212;in   1969, I
think&#8212;working at Arthur D. Little, Inc.,   on a study of expanding the
San Diego airport. This emerged from Penn&#8217;s analysis   as having been a
ski condominium development in Lake Tahoe (a project I had had   nothing
to do with); how it connects to the crimes I have no idea.</b>&nbsp;&nbsp; <br />
<br />
How bizarre does a suspect's behavior have to get before the average Zodiac hobbyist decides he's worth taking seriously as a POI?&nbsp; That depends on what he does for a living and what his background is.&nbsp; If he's a derelict like Arthur Leigh Allen, or a delinquent like "Bob Barnett", even being cleared forensically (both men were initially excluded by fingerprint mismatches) still isn't enough to remove him from the suspect list.<br />
<br />
On the other hand, if he's an academic professional with degrees from Harvard, he can say almost anything, put up a defense so lame it would get him disbarred if he was his own lawyer, and the jury of Zodiac hobbyists will chuckle appreciatively like his own personal laugh track.<br />
<br />
Let's just examine those two sentences of Mr. O'Hare's, quoted above:<br />
<br />
1. Two people have written books accusing him of being the Zodiac killer, but he doesn't remember when he worked in San Francisco.&nbsp; In his entire professional life, Michael O'Hare had exactly ONE job that wasn't located in Greater Boston prior to 1991.&nbsp; He'd worked for MIT, The Commonwealth of Massachusetts, The Boston Museum, and Harvard.&nbsp; The only job he ever held outside Suffolk County was at ADL--just don't ask him WHEN that was, he doesn't recall.<br />
<br />
I'm reluctant to cite Gareth Penn for obvious reasons, but pages 255-257 of <b>Times 17</b> shows us three Michael O'Hare documents: 255), his resume from September 1981, 256), his Architectural Record article from July 1969, and 257), his 1973 dissertation.&nbsp; The resume has him working for ADL in 1967-1968, the AR piece in 1969, and the dissertation in 1970.&nbsp; If you're keeping score along with me, that makes O'Hare, by his own admission, an ADL employee from 1967 until 1970.&nbsp; Granted, he wasn't stationed in San Francisco throughout that period, but the timeline is consistent with his being able to commute back and forth to The Bay Area office for the various planning commission meetings and other work associated with Forest Pines. <br />
<br />
Do you remember the jobs listed on your resume, reader?&nbsp; I've worked more places than Michael O'Hare has, and I can still tick them off, citing dates of employment at various venues, without having to consult any paperwork.&nbsp; All mine are in Greater Pittsburgh, but I'm guessing that if I'd worked one of those jobs in San Francisco, I'd remember exactly when I was there.<br />
<br />
2. O'Hare read just enough of Penn's analysis to know that Penn cited Forest Pines as O'Hare's connection to the Zodiac mailings, but he doesn't know how it connects to the crimes.&nbsp; O'Hare has apparently gone to the trouble of getting copies of Penn's articles, which are only available in publications with tiny circulations, like The Ecphorizer, or maybe he's looked up the information online.&nbsp; On the other hand, O'Hare HASN'T gone to the trouble of reading a book like Robert Graysmith's <b>Zodiac</b>, which is available in the True Crime section of any book store, and the information in Graysmith's book is also available online (<b>Zodiac Unmasked</b> is even available in a Kindle version for 8 bucks).<br />
<br />
3. O'Hare worked at ADL in San Francisco four decades ago.&nbsp; Records of his assignments there would have been kept long before the office was computerized; it is impossible to determine, at this late date, which specific projects he worked on, and his memory isn't to be trusted. <br />
<br />
Michael O'Hare is already asking us to believe that he's been accused of being the Zodiac killer by two different people who wrote books explaining their theories in detail, one of whom actually sent copies of his book to O'Hare's place of employment, The JFK School at Harvard, in 1990, and yet O'Hare hasn't bothered to read either book or ANY book about the Zodiac killer, and only has the vaguest idea what the Zodiac murders were about.&nbsp; This from an academic professional who would, presumably, have a well-developed intellectual curiosity that got him where he is now.<br />
<br />
Lee Harvey Oswald, who denied everything including his purchase of the Carcano rifle used to assassinate JFK, was still a more convincing liar than Michael O'Hare.<br />
<br />
4. If, as police believed, the Zodiac was claiming credit for the Donna Lass murder by sending them a picture of Forest Pines--could he have done that by sending them a picture of the San Diego Airport?&nbsp; The Forest Pines ad, a mere two days old when it was mailed, connects the Zodiac to Donna Lass AND to ADL, and ADL connects to Michael O'Hare.<br />
<br />
5. Neither Michael O'Hare nor Gareth Penn seems to know which condo project the Zodiac referenced in The Lake Tahoe Card.&nbsp; The ad was for Forest Pines, which is a real resort condo that was built, advertised, and can be found on the Internet.<br />
<br />
<a href="http://www.inclineattahoe.com/vacation-rentals/Forest-Pines-1-56-Vacation-Rental/subpage334.html">http://www.inclineattahoe.com/vacation-rentals/Forest-Pines-1-56-Vacation-Rental/subpage334.html</a><br />
<br />
On the other hand, <b>Times 17</b> refers to "Incline Village, Unit 6", a project Penn says was never approved by the local zoning board and thus, never built.&nbsp; As Penn pointed out at the time, Boise Cascade, the developer, "never put two sticks together".<br />
<br />
If the project was never built, how could an ad for it have appeared in The SF Chronicle, and how could police in the area have searched for Donna Lass's burial location in the vicinity, using the punched hole as a reference?<br />
<br />
I suspect the answer to this confusion lies in the timing conflict.&nbsp; If ads for Forest Pines were in The SF Chronicle on March 20, 1971, that means all permit and zoning issues would have been addressed a year or two prior.&nbsp; No developer is going to advertise if he's got nothing to show prospective buyers, so a model at the very least would have been constructed prior to the ad.&nbsp; Before the model was built, any permit and/or zoning issues would have been settled.<br />
<br />
In other words, the permit process for a project that WAS at least partially built by March 1971 would have taken place in 1969/1970.&nbsp; The problem is, Gareth Penn had to suggest that Michael O'Hare was still in The Bay Area later than that, not because he had to be there to commit a murder--with the exception of the Donna Lass murder, there were NO actual Zodiac crimes in The Bay Area after the Robert Salem murder in the spring of 1970--but because he had to be present to mail the letters with local postmarks.<br />
<br />
Of course, since two of the four Zodiac conspirators lived in California, it wasn't really necessary for Michael O'Hare to be on the West Coast throughout that time.&nbsp; By suggesting that O'Hare attended planning commission meetings for "Incline Village, Unit 6" up until March 1971, Gareth Penn gave Michael O'Hare a logistical reason to be there.<br />
<br />
A dozen or so years ago, Mike Butterfield changed his allegiance from Gareth Penn to Michael O'Hare after doing perfunctory research on the South Lake Tahoe Regional Planning Commission, and discovering that O'Hare's name was nowhere to be found among the records for the "Incline Village, Unit 6" application (and subsequent denial).&nbsp; It's hilarious that Butterfield switched horses in the middle of Lake Tahoe, when the ruse was actually set up to cover for O'Hare's absence during some of the 70/71 mailings.&nbsp; It's yet another example of Butterfield's enormous ego outweighing his common sense.&nbsp; &nbsp; <br />
