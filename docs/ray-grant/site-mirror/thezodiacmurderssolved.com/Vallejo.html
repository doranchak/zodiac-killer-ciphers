Most readers will object to the theory behind this book because they
believe no one, and not even a group of people, could plan something so
complicated in such detail so many years in advance.&nbsp; That&#8217;s why I ask
the reader to put any doubts he has on HOLD.<br />
<br />
When he refuses to do that, the reader believes he&#8217;s being skeptical.<br />
<br />
But he&#8217;s not being skeptical at all&#8212;he&#8217;s actually being gullible!<br />
<br />
Let&#8217;s assume, for a moment, that the reader accompanies me on an evening
out, and we go to see a magician saw his assistant in half, and then
wave his magic wand, and somehow put her back together again (as
otherwise she'd be beside herself).&nbsp; At the end of the evening, the
audience applauds the magician.<br />
<br />
But did any of us actually think that he'd taken his assistant apart and
put her back together again?&nbsp; Of course not!&nbsp; Instead, we were
entertained by THE ILLUSION the magician created.<br />
<br />
The same is true of the Zodiac killer.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think he did anything
supernatural.&nbsp; Instead, he and his fellow conspirators sought out what
he was looking for in advance, and then chose among various options
available to him, and used a flexible schedule (and, for that matter, a
language with lots of flexibility) to give the appearance of doing the
impossible.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
I mention this now because what happened in Riverside was relatively
static&#8212;a missing co-ed, a body discovered the morning after, a disabled
car, various artifacts left behind at the scene of the crime--plus the
killer himself is invisible, despite all the potential witnesses that
Sunday.<br />
<br />
In contrast, in Vallejo, both killer and victims are figures on a shifting landscape.<br />
<br />
At Lake Herman Road he's a passing shadow, barely detectable as an oddly
parked car from earlier in the evening, or the second car in a turnout
on a dark road that a passing motorist's headlights illuminate for just a
moment.<br />
<br />
At Blue Rock Springs, a surviving victim recalls a mysterious driver
lurking, and then suddenly pulling up behind the couple, walking to the
passenger side and opening fire, and then just as abruptly getting back
in his car and driving away.<br />
&nbsp;<br />
How could the Zodiac killer possibly have chosen his victims ahead of
time and then placed them, when the circumstances seem to suggest
otherwise?<br />
<br />
I don&#8217;t pretend to know the specifics of his &#8220;tricks&#8221;.<br />
<br />
But the evidence suggests he was able, somehow, to pull it off.<br />
<br />
They say Fortune Favors The Prepared Mind . . . and what he did wasn&#8217;t magic.<br />

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
1. On Friday night, December 20, 1968, David Faraday, 17, and Betty Lou
Jensen, 16, were shot to death with a .22 rifle in a lovers lane on Lake
Herman Road in Vallejo, California.&nbsp; There were no eyewitnesses; their
bodies were discovered by a passing motorist.<br />
<br />
2.&nbsp; The gunman apparently &#8220;herded&#8221; the couple out the passenger side of
the car by firing bullets into the right rear window and the left rear
wheel well.&nbsp; The couple scrambled out the passenger side, where they
were shot dead by the gunman coming around behind them.<br />
<br />
3. The killer shot David Faraday point blank in the left temple, then
put five shots in Betty Lou&#8217;s upper chest.&nbsp; This was remarkable
marksmanship, considering he was pursuing her on gravel and the area was
pitch dark that time of night.<br />
<br />
4. On the night of July 4-5, 1969, Darlene Ferrin, 22, and a companion,
Michael Mageau, 19, were the victims of another lovers lane shooting,
this time in a clearing near a grove of trees in Blue Rock Springs Park,
less than a mile from the Lake Herman Road murder scene.&nbsp; This time the
weapon was a .9mm Luger.&nbsp; Darlene, the driver, was mortally wounded,
but Michael ultimately recovered and was able to describe his attacker
to a police artist.<br />
<br />
5. Michael Mageau described Darlene&#8217;s car being &#8220;herded&#8221; into the area
by a motorist who tailgated her until her own Corvair stalled against a
fallen log.&nbsp; When the other driver got out, he shone a flashlight in at
them.&nbsp; Assuming it was the police, they reached for their wallets.&nbsp; The
man approached from the passenger side and began firing in through the
window.<br />
<br />
6. At 12:40AM, the killer made a phone call to The Vallejo Police
Department.&nbsp; &#8220; I want to report a double murder.&nbsp; If you will go one
mile east on the Columbus Parkway to the public park, you will find kids
in a brown car.&nbsp; They were shot with a 9-millimeter Luger.&nbsp; I also
killed those kids last year.&nbsp; Goodbye.&#8221;&nbsp; The final word was delivered in
a taunting tone.<br />
<br />
7. For all his nerve, the killer was startled when the pay phone began
ringing as soon as he hung up.&nbsp; This drew the attention of a black man
who happened to be passing the lit phone booth.&nbsp; The killer lifted the
receiver and let it hang to stop it from ringing before exiting the
booth.<br />
<br />
8. Beginning at 1:30AM, three members of Darlene&#8217;s family--her husband,
his parents, and his brother--all received odd calls in which only the
sound of breathing could be heard, even though there had been no radio
or TV news on the murder as yet.</font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">I&#8217;ve already discussed the north leg of the Zodiac killer&#8217;s radian, which runs through both Vallejo crime scenes.</font></font></font></font></font><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">

Since we&#8217;ve looked at the geometry of the crimes, let&#8217;s now consider the human element.<br />
<br />
I&#8217;m about to make what the reader may think is a ridiculous
observation.&nbsp; In fact, what I&#8217;m going to say will sound so preposterous,
the reader may be tempted to abandon all hope and say to Hell with it!<br />
<br />
But here goes:&nbsp; The significant victims in Vallejo were David Faraday and Darlene Ferrin.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s not that the Zodiac wasn&#8217;t trying to kill Betty Lou Jensen and
Michael Mageau; obviously, he was.&nbsp; In fact, his failure to kill Michael
Mageau may very well have cost Robert Salem his life.<br />
But the victims who really mattered were the DRIVERS of the two cars.<br />
<br />
Why?&nbsp; Let me answer that question by asking another one:<br />
<br />
Does the reader notice anything odd about the <i>names</i> of the two drivers?<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>David&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Faraday<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Darlene Ferrin<br />
</b><br />
That&#8217;s correct.&nbsp; The drivers of the two cars had the same initials.<br />
Yes, I know it sounds absurd, but suspend your disbelief.<br />
Both drivers were &#8216;DF&#8217;s.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>D&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;F<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;4&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 6&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;(alphabet numbers)</b><br />
<br />
Obviously, the number 46 is 2 x 23.&nbsp; If you were trying to make the
point that 2 x 23 was a basic theme of your murder puzzle, whom would
you choose to kill?&nbsp; You might want to choose two victims with the
initials DF, featured in mirror-image crimes.<br />
<br />
If you think this sounds much too simple, you&#8217;re right.<br />
There is more going on here than meets the eye.<br />
<br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 24px;"></font></font></font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Ferrin Phone Calls</font></font></font><br />
</div>
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
Let&#8217;s begin with something that should be obvious to everyone.&nbsp; In fact,
it&#8217;s so obvious that Robert Graysmith actually notices it, and his
character in the movie mentions it to the Dave Toschi character (I say
the characters mention it because the movie is highly fictionalized).<br />
<br />
Someone makes three phone calls, beginning at 1:30am on July 5, 1969:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1, to Dean Ferrin;<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;2, to Dean&#8217;s parents; and<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;3, to Dean&#8217;s brother.<br />
<br />
The caller says nothing in any of the phone calls, but his breathing can
be heard.&nbsp; The calls, made barely 90 minutes following the murder,
cannot be the result of news accounts of the homicide, since news of the
incident had not hit the airwaves as yet.<br />
<br />
It is reasonable to assume the Zodiac made all three calls, particularly
since he was in the habit of making phone calls following his murders.<br />
<br />
Note that all three calls were made to people named FERRIN.&nbsp; No one
called Darlene&#8217;s mother, who also lived in the area, even though she was
a relative of the victim.&nbsp; Darlene&#8217;s mother wasn&#8217;t called because her
last name wasn&#8217;t FERRIN.<br />
<br />
The Zodiac killer calls to demonstrate that he knew who the victim was.&nbsp;
That much is evident just from the fact of the phone calls.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also
why he shines a flashlight at the victims in Blue Rock Springs Park,
something he probably also did in the earlier episode on Lake Herman
Road.&nbsp; The flashlight serves the dual purpose of freezing the victims
(because they assume it&#8217;s the police, and technically they&#8217;re
trespassing) and visually confirming their identities.<br />
<br />
But the three phone calls to people named FERRIN also suggests something
else, something much more sinister.&nbsp; The Zodiac killer is telling us
her <i>name</i> is significant.&nbsp; Her <i>name</i> is why she was chosen as a victim.</font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">
I&#8217;m getting ahead of myself here, but let&#8217;s look at The Cryptogram cover
letters and the August 4, 1969 letter, which is the first time the
killer says, &#8220; This is the Zodiac speaking . . .&#8221;<br />
<br />
In The Cryptogram cover letters, he cites the Vallejo crime details
chronologically&#8212;December 20th, then July 4th.&nbsp; On August 4th , he cites
them backward (July 4th, THEN December 20th).&nbsp; He does this to
underscore that the Vallejo crimes are mirror-images of each other
(except, of course, for all those Winchester Western slugs littering the
Blue Rock Springs Park crime scene.&nbsp; The Vallejo crime scenes have to
be paired in the context of The Zodiac Project, because they both lie
along the north leg of the radian.<br />
<br />
In more than 40 years, no one has commented on the Zodiac killer&#8217;s
switching the order of the crimes in consecutive letters, but he does it
to make a point.&nbsp; Lake Herman Road and Blue Rock Springs are
essentially the same crime.</font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">Again, I have to cite some examples out of their chronological order
here, but this is probably the best place to make this point.&nbsp; If you
make the same assumption I&#8217;m making&#8212;that David Faraday and Darlene
Ferrin were the Zodiac killer's &#8220;real&#8221; intended victims in Vallejo, not
Betty Lou Jensen and/or Michael Mageau, who were literally just along
for the ride&#8212;then something else falls into place.&nbsp; He was attacking his
&#8220;public&#8221; victims in alphabetical order:<br />
<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Bates, Cheri (10-30-66)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Faraday, David (12-20-68)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Ferrin, Darlene (7-4-69)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hartnell, Bryan (9-27-69)<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;Stine, Paul (10-11-69)</b><br />
<br />
<br />
This is yet another way of saying that the alphabet is important.</font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">We talked about <b>Dante&#8217;s Inferno</b> earlier.&nbsp; <b>The Inferno</b>
begins on the night of Holy Thursday, April 7, 1300 . . . but Dante
actually enters Hell on Good Friday, and comes back up out of Hell on
the morning of Easter Sunday.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>Good Friday . . . Easter Sunday.</b><br />
<br />
Could it be that the Zodiac killer is illustrating this journey in his
own travels?&nbsp; After all, the Zodiac murders all occur on what we in the
modern world think of as a weekend--Friday, Saturday, and Sunday--which
corresponds to the time Dante spends in Hell.<br />
<br />
Would it be fair to say Easter is the finished product of <b>Dante&#8217;s Inferno</b>?<br />
<br />
And would it be fair to say that the victims--in this case, David
Faraday and Darlene Ferrin--are the finished products of The Zodiac
Project?&nbsp; If the Zodiac killer wanted to make that point, how might he
do it?<br />

<br />
Remember, the Zodiac killer must have chosen Cheri Bates ahead of
time--that&#8217;s why he disabled her car.&nbsp; I think it equally clear that he
chose David and Darlene in advance, and the evidence for that is hidden
inside their names.<br />
<br />
As I said in the previous section, Easter is the finished product of <b>Dante&#8217;s Inferno</b>&#8212;it&#8217;s
Easter Sunday morning when Dante comes up out of Hell.&nbsp; And the
Easter-victims&#8212;David Faraday and Darlene Ferrin&#8212;are finished products of
the Zodiac murders.<br />
<br />
He chose them to make that point.</font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
<br />
</font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Code Killer</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font style="font-size: 16px;">It's important to realize the Zodiac wasn't just sending codes in his letters.<br />
<br />
His murders also contained coding, in the names of the victims and where they were killed.<br />
<br />
If this suggests he was selecting his victims in advance and placing
them on the landscape, that's also true, but he was doing something else
as well.<br />
<br />
David Faraday and Darlene Ferrin, the two drivers in Vallejo, were both EASTER victims.<br />
<br />
As we'll see in a moment, Michael O'Hare has a connection to Easter
spelled out in two personal identifiers, his Date of Birth and Social
Security Number.<br />
<br />
Who the victims were didn't decide who he was, of course.<br />
<br />
Who he was decided who the victims were.<br />
<br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Binary SSN</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">Even if David Faraday and Darlene Ferrin did die because the word EASTER
was hidden inside their names, that wouldn&#8217;t necessarily identify
Michael O&#8217;Hare as their killer, would it?<br />
<br />
To complete the picture, we need to take a second look at two of Michael
O'Hare&#8217;s identifying numbers, his Social Security Number and his Date
Of Birth.<br />
<br />
First, his SSN:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>117-32-2128</b><br />
<br />
I decided the most logical way to treat Michael&#8217;s social security number
was as a single number, consisting of the digits in sequence.&nbsp; In other
words, as:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <b>&nbsp;117,322,128</b><br />
<br />
In binary math, this converts to the following:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>110111111100011000110010000<br />
</b><br />
And it&#8217;s an amazing coincidence, but Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s SSN begins with the binary form of the number 223:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>11011111&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1100011000110010000<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;223</b><br />
<br />
It&#8217;s almost as if being the Zodiac had been his fate all along!</font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>110111111100011000110010000</b><br />
<br />
Besides starting off with 223--<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>11011111&nbsp;&nbsp; 1100011000110010000<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;223</b><br />
<br />
--the SSN contains two other interesting expressions in Morse/binary:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>110111111100&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; 0&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;1100011001&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;0000<br />

<br />
Let&#8217;s start with the second expression, 793.&nbsp; It&#8217;s another amazing
coincidence--or maybe not such a coincidence--but 793 just happens to be
the total number of characters contained in the four Zodiac ciphers:<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;<b>The Cryptogram (July 31, 1969)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 408 characters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The 340 Character Cipher (November 8, 1969)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; 340 characters<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;The 13-Character Cipher (April 20, 1970)&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 13 characters<br />

<br />
793 is the total number of cipher characters used by the Zodiac, but GOOD is still the more significant expression of the two.<br />
<br />
What is Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s connection to the EASTER victims?<br />
<br />
His social security number begins with GOOD.<br />
And Michael O&#8217;Hare was born on January 22, 1943--a FRIDAY.<br />
<br />
Michael O&#8217;Hare is GOOD (Friday).<br />
His victims are EASTER (Sunday).<br />
<br />
Together, killer and victims encompass his vision of HELL.</font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />
<br />
<font style="font-size: 24px;"></font></font>
<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Passengers</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">At Lake Herman Road, the Zodiac killer herded the teenagers out the
PASSENGER side of the vehicle, and then immediately struck, shooting
David Faraday in the temple and firing five shots into Betty Lou
Jensen&#8217;s back.&nbsp; At Blue Rock Springs Park, the killer simply walked up
to the PASSENGER side and began firing into the vehicle.<br />
<br />
Subsequently, in Presidio Heights, the Zodiac killer will grab the
driver from the back seat, press a gun against his head and fire one
bullet through his skull, after which he will get into the front seat on
the PASSENGER side and pull the victim&#8217;s body onto the PASSENGER seat. <br />
<br />
Why this preoccupation with the PASSENGER side of each vehicle?&nbsp;
Volkswagen&#8217;s current ad campaign points out that, in life, there are
drivers and passengers, and concludes with a statement you might see on a
sign in the window of a pizza joint: DRIVERS WANTED.<br />
<br />
It&#8217;s also true that in death, there are drivers and passengers.&nbsp; Killers
are the drivers.&nbsp; Victims are the passengers, particularly if they&#8217;re
chosen ahead of time.&nbsp; So the Zodiac killer is demonstrating that,
though the victims may APPEAR to be self-directed in their movements,
they are actually being positioned by him: positioned in space,
positioned in time, positioned as pieces of the puzzle.<br />
<br />
The subsequent murders had more elements of his staging.&nbsp; He puts on a
costume, forces the victims at Lake Berryessa to tie each other up . . .
and then stabs them and leaves a message on their car.&nbsp; He has Paul
Stine first drive to Washington &amp; Maple, and then another block to
Washington &amp; Cherry . . . and THEN kills him.<br />
<br />
In the solution to The Cryptogram, which I&#8217;ll be discussing momentarily, the Zodiac killer says <br />
<br />
<b>The best part of it is thae when I die I will be reborn in paradice and all the I have killed will become my slaves.</b><br />
<br />
What could he mean by that?&nbsp; How could his victims becomes his slaves <i>after</i> he dies?<br />
<br />
They will become his slaves then because, once he dies, it will become clear that he chose all his victims in advance.<br />
<br />
They will thus become completely subservient to his will, and without
lives of their own to speak of.&nbsp; He will be the driver; they will be the
passengers.</font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<br />

<div style="text-align: center;"><font style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 24px;">Original Terminator</font></font><br />
</div>
<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
<font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">Oh, I know what you&#8217;re muttering to yourself, reader.&nbsp; No one, not even the brightest serial killer who ever lived, could pick
his victims ahead of time BY NAME, and then kill them at predetermined
locations.&nbsp; It simply can&#8217;t be done.<br />
<br />
Well, at the very least, this idea isn't inconceivable.&nbsp; The Terminator robot did it in the original movie.&nbsp; He materialized in
Los Angeles, got a phone book, looked up the name &#8216;Sarah Connor&#8217;, and
began showing up at each Sarah Connor&#8217;s front door and killing her.&nbsp; Sooner or later, he was going to kill the &#8220;real&#8221; one!<br />
<br />
So how did the Zodiac killer locate people with names that fit his
design, and then somehow place them on the landscape?&nbsp; The locating
wouldn&#8217;t have been that hard, if you stop to realize that he wasn&#8217;t
looking for specific people.<br />
<br />
He was looking for people with names that fit his requirements.<br />
<br />
And, if you believe what I believe, that the Zodiac killer was actually
four people, you&#8217;ll notice that one of those people was Hugh Penn.<br />
<br />
Hugh Penn, Gareth Penn's father, worked in law enforcement, and was a long-time employee of the
California Highway Patrol.&nbsp; As such, he had access to whatever
information his department had access to.<br />
<br />
Robert Graysmith noticed that the Zodiac killer favored crime venues
with &#8220;water&#8221; names (LAKE Herman Road, Blue Rock SPRINGS, etc.).<br />
<br />
What no one has noticed, in 40+ years of the Zodiac case, is that all
his victims&#8212;the public ones, anyway&#8212;were strongly associated, at the
time of their deaths, to a vehicle:<br />
<br />
Cheri Bates&#8217;s VW was tampered with by her killer.<br />
<br />
David Faraday and Betty Lou Jensen were herded out of their Rambler.<br />
<br />
Darlene Ferrin was shot through the passenger side door of her car.<br />
<br />
The Zodiac killer wrote a message on Bryan Hartnell&#8217;s car.<br />
<br />
Paul Stine was killed at the wheel of his taxi.<br />
<br />
Whether or not he knew THEM, he definitely seemed to know their cars.<br />
<br />
How?&nbsp; If you&#8217;re a supervisor for the CHP, you know everybody&#8217;s car and
everybody&#8217;s driver&#8217;s licence.&nbsp; You have their addresses, and you know
their licence plate numbers (plus the make and model of the cars they
drive).<br />
<br />
But that just gets you their names, home addresses, and vehicles.<br />
<br />
It doesn&#8217;t put them where you need them to be.</font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<font face="Garamond, Times, Serif"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" style="font-size: 16px;"><font style="font-size: 16px;">Before I account for the WHERE, I need
to remind the reader that the Zodiac killer didn&#8217;t murder specific
people.&nbsp; He murdered individuals whose NAMES happened to fit his
requirements.<br />
<br />
In July 1970, he sent The Mikado Letter, in which he admits to having A
Little List of potential victims.&nbsp; I think it&#8217;s probably more accurate
to say he was keeping some sort of chart, a kind of spreadsheet, which included
potential victims, potential murder locations, and so forth.<br />
<br />
It would have required some serious homework, but it wouldn't have been
all that difficult.&nbsp; If you have access to motor vehicle registrations
and driver&#8217;s license
information, your ability to locate someone at any given time is
greatly enhanced.&nbsp; Just a little bit of legwork, following up on those
leads, will give you some familiar patterns to work with.<br />
<br />
For example, I doubt that Darlene Ferrin&#8217;s presence that evening in Blue Rock Springs Park was her first-ever trip
there.&nbsp; I&#8217;m guessing that, like the car-hop place she drives to first
in the movie, it was a regular haunt of hers.&nbsp; That might also explain
the familiarity she seemed to have with the person stalking her; she&#8217;d
probably seen that car around before.<br />
<br />
It might also explain why the Zodiac killer appeared to prey on younger
victims.&nbsp; Teenagers and college-age kids are a bit more predictable in
their patterns than adults are; it would have been much easier for the
Zodiac killer to get a &#8220;fix&#8221; on a younger person, plus they tend to be a lot
more oblivious to their surroundings than suspicious adults are. <br />
<br />
In the 1960s, around the time The Zodiac Project was being planned,
there was a very popular type of puzzle, often found in Reader&#8217;s
Digest, where one received scattered information about a handful of
people.&nbsp; The puzzle itself would consist of perhaps twenty statements,
such as: David drives a Rambler; Darlene smokes Chesterfields; The
Person Who Lives On Via San Jose drives a Volkswagen.&nbsp; You had to make
a chart to solve it, and it usually took the better part of an evening
to figure it all out (largely by a process of elimination, since the
puzzle would finally ask, "Who drives a Corvair?", or, "Whose is
Cecelia's boy friend?").&nbsp; In the end, you'd have a complete profile for
each
person.<br />
<br />
I suspect that&#8217;s what the Zodiac killer was able to do: he kept track of
various requirements (name, address, car, and so forth), and finally
chose whatever was the best combination (or what was available at a given
time).&nbsp; It wasn't magic, but when you removed the scaffolding that
supported it, something that was carefully planned was made to seem
spontaneous.<br />
<br />
Choosing among various elements in a work of art, even when the artwork
itself is open-ended and even interactive with its environment, is part
of the creative process.</font></font><font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />

<font style="font-size: 16px;"><br />
</font>Let&#8217;s review what we&#8217;ve learned on our trip to the North Bay Area.<br />
<br />
Since there were two crime scenes, I&#8217;ll make two points with each section.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<b>1a. Both Vallejo drivers had the initials DF.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
1b. The letters D-F stand for 4-6, or 46, which is 2 x 23.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2a. The Zodiac killer reversed the order of the crime details in consecutive letters.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
2b. The order is reversed to emphasize that the crimes are mirror-images.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3a. Easter Sunday is the finished product of </b><b>Dante&#8217;s Inferno.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
3b. Faraday and Ferrin are finished products of The Zodiac Project.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
4a. The names of both drivers contain the word EASTER in Morse code.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 4b. It is now clear that the Vallejo drivers were chosen well in advance.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5a. Michael O&#8217;Hare&#8217;s SSN contains GOOD, and he was born on a Friday.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
5b. Michael O&#8217;Hare is GOOD Friday; his victims are EASTER Sunday.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
6a. Preoccupation with the passenger side means his victims were placed.<br />
<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
6b. The Zodiac killer calls his victims SLAVES to stress they weren&#8217;t random.</b><br />
