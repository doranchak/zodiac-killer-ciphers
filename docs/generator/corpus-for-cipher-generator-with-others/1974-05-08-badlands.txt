"Editor, SF Chronicle, 5th + Mission, San Fran". 

Sirs -- I would like to expression my consternt consternation concerning your 
poor taste + lack of sympathy for the public, as evidenced by your running of 
the ads for the movie "Badlands," featuring the blurb: "In 1959 most people 
were killing time. Kit + Holly were killing people." In light of recent events, 
this kind of murder-glorification can only be deplorable at best (not that 
glorification of violence was ever justifiable) why don't you show some concern 
for public sensibilities + cut the ad?
