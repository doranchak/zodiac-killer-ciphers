Dear Melvin
This is the Zodiac speaking I wish you a happy Christmass. The one thing I ask 
of you is this, please help me. I cannot reach out because of this thing in me 
won't let me. I am finding it extreamly dificult to keep in check I am afraid I 
will loose control again and take my nineth & posibly tenth victom. Please help 
me I am drownding. At the moment the children are safe from the bomb because it 
is so massive to dig in & the triger mech requires so much work to get it 
adjusted just right. But if I hold back too long from no nine I will loose 
complet all controol of my self & set the bomb up. Please help me I can not 
remain in control for much longer.
