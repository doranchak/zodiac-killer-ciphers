ZKDecrypto is an open-source GPL v2 program whose primary design goal is to solve homophonic (and monophonic) substitution ciphers.<br>
Originally designed to aid in solving the infamous Zodiac Killer's unsolved 340-length cipher, the program has expanded to be capable of<br>
solving general case homophonic and monophonic ciphers in English, German, Spanish and Italian.<br><br>
The program is effectively designed as a "workbench" of sorts, to allow the user to interactively combine the power and speed of the computer<br>
with the user's own language recognition skills in order to more quickly analyze and solve these types of ciphers.  The program will likely not<br>
solve any cipher "perfectly," however, but it can get you very close.  With a bit of ingenuity and trial-and-error, it can generally work well to<br>
solve ciphers of greater than approximately 100-120 length.<br><br>
There is a definite learning curve to using the program effectively, and this can best be achieved through use and experimentation.<br>
Many example/test ciphers are included with the program help new users.  Try to solve these.  The README.RTF file in the "cipher" directory<br>
describes them.  They are basically just ASCII text files, and you can add your own.  Keys are included for some, but most have no key files<br>
included. These ciphers are there for learning purposes.<br><br>
<h3>USAGE NOTES:</h3>
#1. &nbsp;There is a True Type font (zkdfont.ttf) included with the program in the /help/images directory.  While not strictly necessary, it is best if you<br>
install this font into your Windows font directory.  This will allow you to see many of the ciphers using their original symbols instead of their<br>
ASCII equivalents.  You will find this to make things much easier when referring to specific symbols.  While the program itself dynamically loads<br>
and unloads this font on entry and exit, installing it will allow much easier editing and viewing of ciphers.<br><br>

#2. &nbsp;In the "language" directory, you will find four sub-directories, "eng" "spa" "ger" and "ita."  In each of these language directories,<br>
you will find a file named "userdict.txt."  You can add words to this file, and they will be added to all the words the program uses from it's<br>
respective "dictionary.txt" file.  So, if you feel that "Kaczynski," "Gaikowski," or "Lebowski" should be in there, feel free to add it.  Separate<br>
words by spaces or carriage returns. (They don't have to be Polish.)<br><br>

    Idle being the least intensive. <br>
    3. &nbsp;Select your desired priority and a check-mark should appear next 
    to it.<br>
    4. &nbsp;Suggestion - The program is very CPU-Intensive, and runs best on a dual core (or more) system.<br>
    ______________________________________________________________________ <br>
    <a name="lock"></a> <br>
    <b>How to lock/unlock a character to a symbol</b> <br><br>
    1. &nbsp;A character-symbol combination will lock by double clicking. (Alternatively 
    by selecting and Ctrl+L) <br><br>
    <img src="images/LockSymbol1.jpg" /> <br><br>

    it and select Key&gt;Lock Symbol. <br>
    4. &nbsp;You can unlock by double clicking or repeating step 3 and selecting 
    Key&gt;Unlock Symbol (Alternatively by selecting and Ctrl+U) <br>
    5. &nbsp;You can lock and unlock all symbols by select Key&gt;Lock All or 
    Unlock All <br>
    ______________________________________________________________________ <br>
    <a name="merge"></a> <br>
    <b>How to merge symbols and simplify the cipher <br><br>
    </b>Please note: If you suspect that two symbols represent the same plain-text character, it is beneficial to the solver to merge those characters<br>
    together. In general, the fewer the symbols, the easier it is to solve (if it is homophonic). The downfall may be that the merging of incorrect<br>
    symbols destroys the natural expected frequencies between plain characters and cipher characters. <br><br>
    1. &nbsp;Select Cipher&gt;Merge Symbols (Alternatively Ctrl+M). <br><br>
    <img src="images/MergeSymbols1.jpg" /> <br><br>
    2. &nbsp;Select the two symbols you would like to merge in each of the drop 
    down lists.<br><br>
    <img src="images/MergeSymbols2.jpg" /> <br><br>
    3. &nbsp;Click "OK" and the symbols will be automatically merged. <br>
    4. &nbsp;View>Merge Log will show you what symbols have been merged.<br>
    ______________________________________________________________________ <br>
    <br>
    <a name="wordplug"></a> <b>Using the word-plug feature</b> <br><br>
    The word-plug feature takes a word (or words) as input and attempts to place that word in an optimal location within the cipher. It automatically<br>
    adjusts the key when it places the word and locks those character-symbol combinations. This is a more advanced feature that takes practice using.<br>
    It is good to test it out on practice ciphers. Just because it places a word, it doesn't mean that the word is in the actual correct solution. <br><br>
    <img src="images/WordPlug1.jpg" /> <br><br>
    1. &nbsp;Select Solve&gt;Wordplug (Alternatively Ctrl+W). <br>
    2. &nbsp;Type in the word that you want the word-plugger to place. <br>
    3. &nbsp;Click "OK" and it will automatically be placed within the cipher if the score is high enough.<br>
    ______________________________________________________________________ <br>
    <br>
    <a name="exclude"></a> <b>Excluding letters from symbols</b> <br><br>
    Excluding letters allows you to prevent a symbol from taking on a certain 
    letter. This feature is useful for controlling the behavior of symbols. <br>
    <br>
    1. &nbsp;Right click the desired symbol in the key area and select "Exclude 
    Letters" (Alternatively Shift+Ctrl+X). <br><br>
    <img src="images/ExcludeLetters1.jpg" /> <br><br>
    2. &nbsp;Type in all of the letters that you would like to be excluded from 
    that symbol. <br><br>
    <img src="images/ExcludeLetters2.jpg" /> <br><br>
    3. &nbsp;Click "OK" and your changes will take effect. <br>
    4. &nbsp;View>Exclusions will show what letters have been excluded.<br>
    5. &nbsp;Key>Clear Exclude will eliminate all exclusions from all symbols.<br>
    ______________________________________________________________________ <br>
    <br>
    <a name="failure"></a> <b>Changing the maximum allowable failure</b><br><br>
    This feature effectively allows you to control how long the program runs the solver on a given cipher. <br><br>
    1. &nbsp;Select Solve&gt;Options. <br><br>
    <img src="images/SetMaxFailures1.jpg" /> <br><br>
    2. &nbsp;Change the value located in the "Max Failures" textbox to your desired 
    value. <br><br>
    <img src="images/SetMaxFailures2.jpg" /> <br><br>
    3. &nbsp;Click "OK" and your changes will take effect (you should notice the 
    "Failures" number is updated on the "Solve" tab). <br>
    ______________________________________________________________________ <br>
    <br>
    <a name="swaps"></a> <b>Changing the number of random swaps on a key after a failure</b> <br><br>
    This parameter helps give the program more time to work its way out of local maxima when attempting to solve a cipher. <br><br>
    1. &nbsp;Select Solve&gt;Options. <br><br>
    <img src="images/RandomSwaps1.jpg" /> <br><br>
    2. &nbsp;Change the value located in the "Random Swaps" textbox to your desired 
    value. <br>
    3. &nbsp;Click "OK" and your changes will take effect. <br>
    4. &nbsp;The default value is 5. Lower values tend to stick to the best key yet found, while higher values explore the search space more thouroughly.<br>
    5. &nbsp;Suggestion - On some harder ciphers, you might try increasing this number.<br>
    ______________________________________________________________________ <br>
    <br>
    <a name="revert"></a> <b>Changing the revert period</b> <br><br>
    The revert period is how many iterations the program will perform before reverting back to the previous best key.<br>
    This can be an important factor to prevent being stuck in a local maxima. <br><br>
    1. &nbsp;Select Solve&gt;Options. <br><br>
    <img src="images/RevertPeriod1.jpg" /> <br><br>
    2. &nbsp;Change the value located in the "Revert Period" textbox to your desired 
    value. <br>
    3. &nbsp;Click "OK" and your changes will take effect. <br>
    4. &nbsp;The default value is 400. <br>

    <br>
    <a name="transpose"></a> <b>Transposing the cipher text</b> <br><br>
    1. &nbsp;Select Cipher and "Flip Horizontal" or "Flip Vertical" or "Reverse". 
    These menu choices will rearrange the cipher as described.<br><br>
    <img src="images/TransposeCipher1.jpg" /> <br><br>
    2. &nbsp;Your change should take effect immediately. <br><br>
    NOTE:<br> "Flip Horizontal" and "Flip Vertical" will only operate on ciphers that are displayed in a perfect rectangle. "Reverse" works on all ciphers.<br>
    ______________________________________________________________________ <br>
    <br>
    <a name="poly"></a> <b>Performing polyalphabetic analysis (Vigenere, 
    etc...)</b> <br><br>
    This feature is useful for analysing polyalphabetic ciphers. This feature 
    generates a graph with <strong>Key Length on the x-axis</strong> and<br> <strong>Index 
    Of Coincidence on the y-axis</strong>. Vigenere ciphers tend to have a peak 
    index of coincidence on the correct key length. <br><br>
    1. &nbsp;Select Cipher&gt;Polyalphabet Analysis. <br><br>
    <img src="images/PolyalphabeticAnalysis1.jpg" /> <br><br>
    2. &nbsp;Put in a max key length and select "OK". <br><br>
    <img src="images/PolyalphabeticAnalysis2.jpg" /> <br><br>
    3. &nbsp;You should now see a graph. <br>
